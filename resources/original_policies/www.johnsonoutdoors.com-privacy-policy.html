<h2><strong>CCPA Privacy Notice  for California Residents</strong></h2>
<p> <br><br>
  This <strong>Privacy Notice for California Residents</strong> supplements the information contained elsewhere in our Privacy Policy and  applies solely to consumers who reside in the State of California  ("consumers" or "you"). We adopt this notice to comply with  the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). <br><br><u>Information We Collect</u>&gt;<u> </u><br><br>
  We  collect certain information that identifies, relates to, describes, references,  is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or  indirectly, with a particular consumer or device ("<strong>personal information</strong>"). <br><br>
  In  the last twelve months, we have collected the following categories of personal  information from consumers: <br><br><strong><em>Identifiers</em></strong>,  such as real name, alias, postal address, Internet Protocol address, email  address, account name.<br><br><strong><em>Personal information categories listed in the  California Customer Records statute</em></strong>, such as name and contact information.<br><br><strong><em>Commercial information</em></strong>, such as records of products or services purchased, obtained,  or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.<br><br><strong><em>Sensory data</em></strong>, such as audio, electronic, or similar information (e.g.,  records of customer service calls)<br><br><strong><em>Internet or other similar network activity</em></strong>, such as browsing history, search history, information on  a consumer's interaction with a website, application, or advertisement.<br><br><strong><em>Geolocation data</em></strong>, such as physical location or movements. </p>
<ul><li><strong><u>Sources and Purposes of  Collection of Your Personal Information</u></strong></li>
<li>The sources from which  we collect personal information, the business purposes for which we collect  that personal information, and the categories of third parties to whom we  disclose personal information for business purposes are described in the above  sections of our Privacy Policy entitled “<em>What  Information Do We Collect and Why</em>” and “<em>How  Else May We Use Your Information</em>.”</li>
</ul><p><u>Sales of Personal Information</u><u> </u><br><br>
  In  the last twelve months, we have not sold personal information. <br><br><strong><u>Disclosures  of Personal Information for Business Purposes</u></strong> <br><br>
  In  the last twelve months, we have disclosed the above-identified categories of  personal information to third parties for business purposes. <br><br><u>Your Rights and Choices Under the CCPA </u><u> </u><br><br><em>Your Right to Access to Specific Information  and to Data Portability </em><br><br>
You  have the right to request that we disclose to you the following information  about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12  months: </p>
<ul><li>The  categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>The  categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>Our  business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.</li>
<li>The  categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
<li>The  specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a  data portability request). </li>
</ul><p align="left"><em>Your Right to Request Deletion of Personal  Information </em><br><br>
  You  have the right to request that we delete personal information that we collected  from you, although we may deny or limit your request under certain circumstances,  including if we need to retain the information to exercise legal rights, comply  with legal obligations, administer our business, or otherwise use the  information internally in a lawful manner compatible with the context in which  you provided it to us. <br><br><em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and  Deletion Rights</em><br><br>
To  exercise your rights to access, data portability, or deletion, please submit a  verifiable consumer request to us by either: </p>
<ul><li>Calling  us toll-free at 833-904-0891;</li>
<li>Completing  the Contact Us form at <a href="http://www.johnsonoutdoors.com/contact-form">www.johnsonoutdoors.com/contact-form</a>;  or</li>
<li>Emailing  us at <a href="mailto:DataPrivacy@johnsonoutdoors.com">DataPrivacy@johnsonoutdoors.com</a> </li>
</ul><p>In  order to enable us to consider your request, the request must:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Be verifiable:</strong> You must provide  sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person  about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;  and</li>
<li><strong>Be specific:</strong> You must describe your  request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate,  and respond to it.</li>
<li><strong>Be made by an  authorized individual:</strong> Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your  behalf, may make a consumer request related to your personal information. You  may also make a consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</li>
</ul><p>We  cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we  cannot verify (1) your identity; (2) your authority to make the request on  behalf of someone else; or (3) that the personal information relates to you. <br><br>
  You  may only make a consumer request for access or data portability twice within a  12-month period.<br><br><em>Response Timing and Format</em><br><br>
  We  try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five days of its  receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and  extension period in writing.<br><br>
  We  will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option, to  the extent the information is reasonably capable of delivery by your requested  method. <br><br>
  Any  disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt of  a verifiable request. If we cannot comply with a request, we will tell you why. <br><br>
  We  do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request  unless it is excessive or repetitive. If we determine that the request warrants  a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost  estimate before completing your request. <br><br><u>Non-Discrimination</u><u> </u><br><br>
  We  will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights, by (1)  Denying you goods or services; (2) Charging you different prices or rates for  goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or  imposing penalties; (3) Providing you with a different level or quality of  goods or services; or (4) Suggesting that you may receive a different price or  rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or  services.<br><br>
  We  may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that <strong>can result </strong>in different prices, rates,  or quality levels (e.g, one-time discounts for signing up to receive marketing  emails). Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt  in consent, which you may revoke at any time. </p>
