<div class="htmleditor-text-wrapper " style="letter-spacing: 0.0em;"><div>As of February 4, 2013, Canadian Tire has adopted the fair rounding approach for CASH transactions. When proper change is not available, the amount owing after tax will be rounded to the nearest $.05.</div><div><br></div><div>· Rounded down: If the last digit of the amount is 1, 2, 6 or 7.</div><div>· Rounded up: If the last digit of the amount is 3, 4, 8 or 9.</div><div>· Rounding does not apply to Debit, Credit or Gift Card payments, unless it is a split payment, in which case, split payment rules apply.</div><div>· On split payment transactions, if cash is the last method of payment used, the amount owing will be subjected to rounding. If cash is not the last payment type tendered, no rounding will take effect.</div><div>· You can still pay the unrounded total in cash if you have the correct change. For example, if the amount owing after tax is $10.03, and you have 3 pennies, you can pay the unrounded total.</div><div>· These rules apply to U.S. currency as well.</div><div>· Canadian Tire ‘Money’ will be issued on the pre-rounded amount.</div><div>· Rounding will also be applied to refunds paid out in cash.</div><div>· Purchases made with Gift Cards will be settled to the exact amount.</div><div>· Auto Work orders are also subject to rounding, which is done at the register. Therefore, the total on the work order may not match the total being paid at the register.</div><div><br></div></div>

Following are some examples of the personal information that our Retail Services, Financial Services and the Canadian Tire loyalty reward program or other loyalty or preferred customer programs (each Loyalty Program) need and why.<br><br><div><u>Retail Services&nbsp;</u></div><div>Most of the information collected about you for retail services is very basic information that we need to complete a purchase, provide you with a refund or exchange or process and keep track of transactions. Examples of information that may be collected to complete an in-person purchase, or refund may include things such as your name, address, telephone number, and a description of the item requested or purchased.&nbsp;</div><br><div>Generally, we request your address and phone number only if the item you purchased will be sent to you at a later date, or if you are receiving a refund.&nbsp;</div><br><div>You may visit one of Canadian Tire’s websites just to browse, or make an online purchase. If you make a purchase, we collect personal information such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit card information. For details about the information we collect on our Website, see the section below on Cookies.</div><br><div><u>Financial Services</u></div><div>Banks and financial institutions require certain information in order to open credit-related accounts and deposit accounts. For example, name, address and date of birth are required to identify you and process your application; information about your background (for example, occupation) and financial circumstances like assets, income, other financial commitments, to determine if you are eligible for products and services; credit reports and other information to assess and update your credit worthiness; transactional and payment patterns to identify credit risk, fraud risk, and suspicious activities and to fulfill regulatory obligations such as anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations.</div><div>Depending on the financial product, some information is required by law. For example, your name, address, date of birth, employment information and details of government issued identification documents are required under anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations, and your social insurance number (SIN) is required for reporting purposes under the Income Tax Act.</div><br><br><div><u>Demographic Information.</u></div><div>We may use personal information in an aggregated, de-identified form about our customers to improve our services, to study trends, for statistical analysis, to develop products and programs, for marketing purposes and/or for industry reporting purposes. We may share such aggregated, de-identified information with members of the Canadian Tire family of companies, our partners, our agents, service providers and advertisers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div>

The following are some examples of the information that we may need from you and why.<br><br><div><u>Retail Services&nbsp;</u></div><div>Mark’s has created an online database on marks.com. Customers may register on the database to enable tracking of on-line purchases at www.marks.com. Registration is entirely voluntary and customers may correct their information or remove themselves from the database at any time.&nbsp;</div><div>Mark’s may also collect personal information about employees of various companies who are Mark’s corporate clients. For example, a company may contract with Mark’s to supply all of its employee uniforms. When the employee makes his or her purchase, Mark’s collects information about the nature of that employee's purchases, and may provide that information to the employer.&nbsp;</div><br><div>Sometimes you may voluntarily provide information to Mark’s. For example, this occurs when you fill out Mark’s Customer Satisfaction Survey. The goal of this program is to gauge customer feedback via both an Internet and telephone survey. The survey will ask customers a variety of questions regarding their most recent experience at the store and will help ensure that we consistently deliver an excellent customer experience. Mark’s uses that information to respond to your query, and to keep track of customer feedback, which enables us to continuously improve.&nbsp;</div><br><div>Canadian Tire online may collect your name, email, postal code, country and phone number in order to provide you with information on upcoming sales. Mark’s may collect your email address, name, address, city, province, country, postal code, gender, household income and age range in order to provide you with advance notice of upcoming promotions and exclusive offers, news of on-line and in-store special event, information on products and services and notices of contests. PartSource may collect your name, email and postal code in order to send you a monthly e-newsletter and money saving coupon offers.</div><br><div><u>Financial Services</u></div><div>We need your name and address in order to prepare and send you a monthly statement for your card account.</div><br><div>Canadian Tire Bank is also required by law to know its customers and to verify the identity of its customers before entering into a business relationship or opening an account. Canadian Tire Bank uses third parties including credit bureaus/consumer reporting agencies for these purposes and we need your consent to do this. If you do not provide us with your consent, we cannot enter into a business relationship with you or open an account for you.</div><div><br></div></div>

The Program is made available by Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited (referred to as Canadian Tire or we) on the following terms and conditions.<div>&nbsp;</div><div>Participating in the Program</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In order to collect and redeem electronic Canadian Tire Money (eCTM®), you must become a member (a Member). Membership is open to you if you are an individual, you reside in Canada and you are of the age of majority in the province in which you reside.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You can become a Member by (i) completing the registration process online at canadiantire.ca (the Program Website) or (ii) by downloading the Program application to your mobile phone or device (the Program App) which you can receive information on by calling Program customer service at 1-800-226-8473 or by visiting the Program Website, or (iii) by applying for a credit card issued by Canadian Tire Bank that is designated as being linked to the Program or by being issued a debit card connected to a bank account from Canadian Tire Bank that is designated as being linked to the Program (a Program Payment Card), or (iv) by calling customer service at 1-800-226-8473 after you have picked up a Triangle Rewards Card in store.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you apply for a credit card that is a Program Payment Card and are not approved you will still become a Member of the Triangle Rewards Program if you provided all of the necessary information unless, at time of application for such credit card, you were advised that you would have to enroll separately in the Triangle Rewards Program in the event your credit card application was declined or unless we otherwise notify you in writing.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Triangle Rewards Cards</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Each Member may receive a Triangle Rewards Program card (a Triangle Rewards Card) that is linked to a Triangle Rewards Account. Your eCTM will be stored in that account. If you do not receive a Triangle Rewards Card you will need to use a Cardless Method (see below) when you collect or redeem eCTM.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Any Program Payment Cards that are issued to a Member will also be linked to that Member’s Triangle Rewards Account. If a Member has multiple Program Payment Cards they cannot be linked to the same Triangle Rewards Account.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>A Member can request the issuance of additional Triangle Rewards Cards that have the same account number as that Member’s Triangle Rewards Account.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Collecting electronic Canadian Tire Money</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>eCTM can be collected when you purchase Eligible Merchandise (see below) at participating Canadian Tire stores or on-line at canadiantire.ca (or such other web site as may be designated by Canadian Tire from time to time). eCTM is calculated on the pre-tax, purchase amount (or eligible portion thereof) and is rounded to the nearest cent. To collect eCTM you must present a Triangle Rewards Card (or use a Cardless Method described below). You can also collect eCTM on that portion of a purchase charged to a Program Payment Card. The Program Payment Card must be linked to a Triangle Rewards Account at the time the purchase is made in order to collect eCTM.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>eCTM can also be collected when you purchase fuel (gasoline or diesel) at participating Canadian Tire gas bars and present a Triangle Rewards Card (or use a Cardless Method described below) and use a qualifying form of tender or if you pay for the purchase with a Program Payment Card. The amount of eCTM collected on fuel purchases depends on the number of litres purchased. A minimum fuel purchase may be required before eCTM can be collected. The rate of collection may vary from time to time and by location and by type of tender used for payment so check at your local Canadian Tire gas bar. eCTM can only be collected at Canadian Tire gas bars on fuel purchases.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You can also collect eCTM on purchases that you make at other merchants that are charged to a Program Payment Card. eCTM that you collect at other merchants will also be rounded to the nearest cent.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The rate at which eCTM can be collected may vary from time to time and by location and is subject to change by Canadian Tire without notice. In addition, you may collect eCTM at a different rate if you pay with a Program Payment Card than you would if you use a Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method) or based on the type of Program Payment Card that you use. Please call 1-800-226-8473 for current rates.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>When shopping at Canadian Tire stores or gas bars, if you forget your Triangle Rewards Card or choose not to use it, you may still be able to collect eCTM on a qualifying purchase if you provide the telephone number that you gave when you enrolled as a Member or you scan at a compatible point of sale device your mobile phone or other mobile device on which you have downloaded the Program App (each of these is a Cardless Method).&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Purchases made in a foreign currency with a Program Payment Card are first converted into Canadian currency (as set out in the cardmember agreement) prior to calculating the amount of eCTM that you have collected.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>eCTM can only be collected on one Triangle Rewards Account for each purchase transaction.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you use a Triangle Rewards Card or Cardless Method, it must be swiped or scanned or your phone number provided, as the case may be, before you make your purchase. When shopping online at canadiantire.ca (or other website as designated by Canadian Tire), you must enter your Triangle Rewards Account number at check out to collect eCTM.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Members are also eligible to collect bonus eCTM, or to collect eCTM at a promotional rate offered from time to time on the purchase of select items, upon the occurrence of certain events or as part of a promotion or offer, but unless otherwise indicated, bonus eCTM or eCTM awarded at a promotional rate is awarded only once for a transaction, or for the occurrence of an event, as the case may be.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You cannot use a Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method) together with a Program Payment Card. If you charge a purchase to a Program Payment Card, you will only earn eCTM at the applicable Program Payment Card rate then in effect, even if you also present your Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method). However, if you redeem eCTM to pay for part of a transaction and pay for the balance of the transaction with a Program Payment Card that is linked to a different Triangle Rewards Account than the account from which the redemption is occurring, all eCTM collected in respect of that transaction will be credited to the Triangle Rewards Account from which redemption is occurring.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You will not be able to collect eCTM on that portion of a transaction in respect of which you redeemed eCTM. However, we may, from time to time and at our discretion, have special offers or promotions that would allow you to collect eCTM on that portion of a transaction in respect of which you redeemed eCTM.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you use more than one Program Payment Card to make a purchase (e.g. split the cost between two or more cards), all eCTM collected on that purchase will be credited only to the Triangle Rewards Account linked to the first Program Payment Card that is presented.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you make payment using a Program Payment Card in combination with some other form of tender, only that portion of the purchase charged to the Program Payment Card will earn eCTM at the then applicable Program Payment Card rate. That portion of the purchases made with the other form of tender may be eligible to earn eCTM at a different rate.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Delays may occur in recording eCTM to a Triangle Rewards Account. You cannot collect paper Canadian Tire Money® and eCTM on the same transaction.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you are the holder of a Program Payment Card and you fail to keep your credit card account, or bank account to which your debit card is linked, in good standing, any eCTM that you might have collected as a result of transactions with that Program Payment Card, may, in Canadian Tire’s sole discretion, be cancelled.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Eligible Merchandise</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>All merchandise sold at Canadian Tire stores, or on-line at canadiantire.ca, is Eligible Merchandise except the following: gift cards, lottery tickets, hunting and fishing licences, tire disposal fees, tire taxes, Rug Doctor® rental charges, refundable deposits, environmental fees, repair charges, delivery or assembly charges, other store services (other than automobile service), inter-store sales, other store labour (other than labour for automobile repairs), donations at a discount, house account charges, towing charges, prepaid cards, phone cards, tobacco products or alcohol, Pit Stop® parts/labour charges, Canadian Tire Roadside Assistance® memberships that are purchased over the phone or on-line, premiums for credit card balance insurance or for insurance or extended warranties on items purchased with a Canadian Tire branded credit card, premiums for other Canadian Tire branded insurance products, cash advances, transactions using a convenience cheque, balance transfers and other cash transactions, any fees charged on a Program Payment Card, payments made to a credit card account, the value of any part or item traded-in in connection with a purchase, any item that we are legally precluded from awarding eCTM in respect of and such other goods or services as we may determine from time to time in our sole discretion.

We reserve the right, at any time without notice, to change what constitutes Eligible Merchandise.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Redeeming electronic Canadian Tire Money</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>eCTM can only be redeemed for merchandise (including applicable taxes) at participating Canadian Tire stores or at other locations designated by Canadian Tire.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>eCTM cannot be redeemed for alcohol, tobacco, gift cards, pre-paid cards, other stored value cards or products, items that we designate on the Program Website and those items which the law does not permit to be purchased this way, or used to make a payment on any Canadian Tire Bank issued credit cards or on loans or for financial or insurance products or in respect of fees or overdraft on any Canadian Tire Bank provided bank account.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>To redeem your eCTM you must present your Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method) or Program Payment Card to the cashier with your purchase. Please note that in some Canadian Tire stores it may not be possible to simply provide your phone number when redeeming eCTM; presentation of your Triangle Rewards Card or Program Payment Card or scanning of the Program App may be required instead. eCTM can be used in combination with paper Canadian Tire Money and/or in combination with any other form of tender.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>eCTM collected on a purchase transaction cannot be redeemed on the same transaction.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You may not redeem eCTM from more than one Triangle Rewards Account for the same transaction.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You must have enrolled in the Program, or have activated your Program Payment Card, in order to redeem eCTM.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>What Happens When an Item is Returned?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you return an item for a refund and had received eCTM when you purchased such item, such amount of eCTM will be deducted from your Triangle Rewards Account.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Merchandise that was purchased either in whole or in part by redeeming eCTM may not be returned for cash, rather, the connected Triangle Rewards Account will be credited with the same amount of eCTM used to make the original purchase.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Expiration of Electronic Canadian Tire Money</div><div><br></div><div>We may expire the eCTM in your Triangle Rewards Account in the event that there has been a period of inactivity of 18 months or more.

That merged account will bear the Triangle Rewards Account number of one of the accounts being merged and one Member will be designated as the holder of that account with full power and authority to deal with the account, including closing it, and will become the “Member” hereunder.
