        Last updated: December 2019
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome, and thank you for your interest in YDesign Group, LLC ("YDesign", "we," or "us") and our web sites at www.yliving.com, www.ylighting.com, www.ydesigngroup.com, and www.lumens.com (each a "Site," altogether the "Sites"), as well as all related web sites, networks, embeddable widgets, downloadable software, mobile applications (including tablet applications), and other services provided by us, (collectively, together with the Sites, our "Service"). Protecting your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the information that we gather from you on the Service, how we use and disclose that information, and the steps we take to protect that information. All of our Sites and related providers of the Service display a link to this Policy.

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            How We Collect Your Information
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        When you use the Service, we collect information about you to optimize your experience. This information falls into three general categories: information voluntarily provided by you, information we obtain when you use the Service, and information we collect through third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Information You Voluntarily Provide:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        When you interact with us, we collect information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, you may give us your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”), which includes, but is not limited to, Identifiers such as your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number. We may collect the information you voluntarily provide when you communicate with us by phone, email, or other messaging features, interact with us or other users of the Service through any messaging features, including bulletin boards or chat rooms, or send us customer service-related requests.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

        We may also collect Personal Information when you use the Service, such as when you register for an account, place an order or make an inquiry by phone, post reviews or other materials, visit our store, place an order on the Service or otherwise contact us. The information we collect when you use -our Service includes, but is not limited to, the following:

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Usage Information
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies:
    </p>
    <p>
        When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies—small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters—to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.
    </p>
    <p>
        Automatically Collected Information
    </p>
    <p>
        When you use the Service, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Information We Get From Third Parties
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also implement third-party content or advertising on the Service that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as the Pinterest "Pin It" button) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through those third parties' browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and YDesign Group does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. Please see "More Information about Advertising" below to learn about how we work with third parties for our advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third Party Service Providers; Google Analytics
    </p>
    <p>
        We may work with different companies and third party service providers who offer services that can assist us in better understanding how users of our Service interact with and use our Service or otherwise assist us in providing the Service ("Third Party Service Providers"). We may permit such Third Party Service Providers to use certain technologies, including without limitation web beacons and cookies, to collect certain personal information or non-personally identifiable information in connection with the provision of such services to us. For example, we currently use and may continue to use a product called Google Analytics by permitting Google Inc. to use technologies such as web beacons and cookies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information that helps us understand your usage of our Service. We may permit Google and other third party analytics providers to combine information collected through our Service with information collected from third party services, and these analytics providers may use this information to help us better understand our users, and these analytics providers may also use this information to help their other customers better understand their users. Additionally, we currently use and may continue to use a version of Google Analytics called Google Analytics for Display Advertisers, which enables Google to collect, use, and disclose information in connection with certain advertising activities. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads at
        <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">
            https://www.google.com/settings/ads
        </a>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
    </p>
    <p>
        We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to Customers' personally identifiable information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. Also, clear gifs, which may be set by a third party, are used on pages to track sales, which may result from our Internet advertising campaigns and banner advertisements appearing on other web sites. In order to track the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, aggregate data pertaining to the dollar amount spent, items purchased, and campaign the customer responded to, is sent to third party servers for the purpose of tracking which sales resulted from specific advertising campaigns and to track conversion sales coming from banner advertisements. No individually identifiable data is sent to third party servers, only data that reflects that a sale occurred. If Customers would like to opt-out of these e-mails, they should see the Opt-out section.
    </p>
    <p>
        Integrated Services
    </p>
    <p>
        You may be given the option to access, register for, or place an order on the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an "Integrated Service"), such as through the use of your PayPal account credentials, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide personal information or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store the information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Information from Other Sources
    </p>
    <p>
        We may obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers, and Integrated Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Policy.
    </p>
    <p>

            How We Use Your Information
        </strong>

            More Information A bout Our Third Party Advertising Practices
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may work with third party companies to help us tailor advertising on our Service and to place ads on other unaffiliated sites and services. In connection with this advertising, these third party companies may use information about your use of the Service, such as information about the pages and products that you have viewed.

        Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information has been collected on the Service from persons under 16 years of age, we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

        We use reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards that are designed to protect the integrity and security of your personally identifiable information under our control. Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and, therefore, we cannot guarantee that your information will remain secure.

    </p>
    <p>
        Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain personal information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. When registering an account, it is your responsibility to choose an account password that is difficult for others to guess, preferably a password you do not use on any other website or account, and never reveal it to anyone else. If you use a shared or public computer, DO NOT choose to have your login ID or password remembered and log out of your account completely every time you leave the computer. Also, please verify that your web browser has a secure connection to the websites before entering any personally identifying information and avoid including personally identifying information in e-mails to us (particularly credit card or banking information).

            Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
        </li>
        <li>
            Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
        </li>
        <li>
            Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

            Response Timing and Format

    <p>
        We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
