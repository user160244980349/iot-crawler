    Customers love KONO  Let them tell you how much!

        “I’ve been looking for a smart Wi-Fi thermostat for a while now, but nearly all of them are white and look quite cheap, even if they are not. Then I came across the ‘Kono Smart Wi-Fi Thermostat with Interchangeable Black Stainless Steel Faceplate which is a great modern looking design. The interchangeable face plate makes it easy to fit the look to your house and style.”

        “Modern looking changeable faceplates, works great. I control and monitor the temp through the app. Absolutely great product for a fraction of the cost of similar items.”

        “This is a great Thermostat! I was looking for a smart WiFi capable unit that wasn’t overpowering in size, like the Honeywell, but provided full functionality... This unit fit the bill &amp; frankly I think it has a significant advantage over the Nest unit.”

        “Attractive, feature rich, easy to install and the price was right! I did not want to go spend $300 for a smart WiFi thermostat. Overall, the youtube videos made the whole setup seamless, and the app is very user intuitive. I really enjoy the “runtime per hour” information and the helpful tips during the setup because of the cost savings associated with the various configurations.”
