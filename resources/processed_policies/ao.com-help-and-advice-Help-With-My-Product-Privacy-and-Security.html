    <h2>
        How we use your personal data
    </h2>
    <p>
        We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. We only collect, keep, use or share your information for genuine business purposes in our legitimate interests, when you’ve approved us to do so or when we’re legally obliged to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (for example when you buy a washing machine or mobile phone).
        </li>
        <li>
            Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
        </li>
        <li>
            Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.
        </li>
        <li>
            In limited circumstances, we may request your consent to process your personal data.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Lawful Basis
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        For AO to be allowed to process your personal data, we must have a legal basis for the processing. The data protection legislation sets out what these bases are. We have described below the different bases that we rely on and provided examples of the processing.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Legitimate Interest
            </strong>
            means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us. If you do not want us to process any of the personal data we have listed as being processed for legitimate interests, you have the right to object. For more information see the section below relating to your rights. Please note that if you object we may still continue to process your personal data in certain circumstances. Please also remember that if we can’t process your personal data for these purposes your customer experience may not be as enjoyable.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Performance of Contract
            </strong>
            means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract. For example when you buy a product or service on any of our Sites, it creates a contract between us. We need to process your personal data that you provide in the order to fulfil our part of the contract and deliver the products to you. If you do not provide your details we won’t be able to complete your order.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Comply with a legal obligation
            </strong>
            means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to. For example, if you buy a product which is an age restricted item (such as a game rated 18) or if there is a product recall.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Consent
            </strong>
            means processing your personal data where you have explicitly told us that you will allow us to do so. In some cases, we will ask whether you would like us to process your personal data. For example, when an item is out of stock and you provide your telephone number for us to call to discuss available alternatives or notify you when the out of stock item becomes available. If you provide us with consent, you may withdraw it at any time by contacting us.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Purposes for which we will use your personal data
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.

    </p>
    <p>
        We may contact you by telephone shortly after your purchase to discuss your delivery and make sure that it all goes smoothly for you. We may also offer you other services which relate to the products that you have purchased. If you decide not to purchase a product protection plan on such call we may contact you around the expiry of the manufacturer’s guarantee to see whether this would then be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these calls, please contact us by phone, email or post.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note, if you submit information in relation to your order but there is an error or delay in processing, we may use the details you've submitted to contact you to complete your order.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also contact you when an item is out of stock, have requested to discuss available alternatives or notify you when the out of stock item becomes available or you have requested updates on product releases. Please note If you have asked us to notify you when an out of stock item becomes available, the email will not have an unsubscribe link in it as it is a single email notification. Unsubscribing from marketing will not affect your ability to receive an out of stock notification.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you rent one of our products, we may contact you prior to your payment due date to remind about your upcoming payment. If you fail to make payments in line with the rental agreement, we may contact you via telephone, SMS, email and post to ensure the arrears are cleared. If we contact you during this process and we feel that you may be considered a vulnerable individual we may need to ask you for sensitive information and may require medical information from you. We will always request consent when processing information regarding vulnerable customers.

        AO may transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are either part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US or we have put the correct Standard Contractual Clauses in place. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield or Standard Contractual Clauses.

        Data retention

        <strong>
            How long will you use my personal data for?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        By law we have to keep basic information about our customers relating to purchases and rentals (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax and other regulatory purposes. We retain your transaction data for a period of ten years after your purchase, this is a requirement inline with certain product liability provisions under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you call or message our contact centre with an enquiry (but do not place an order) we will keep your personal data for one month.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you ask us to notify you about an out of stock item, we will do so if it becomes available within one month of your request.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you receive marketing emails and SMS from us and have not unsubscribed from these messages we will continue to process your personal data for this purpose for a maximum period of four years. You may ask us to stop processing for this purpose at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see

        below for further information.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

    <h2>
        Your legal rights
    </h2>
    <p>
        Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Request access
        </strong>
        to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Request correction
        </strong>
        of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Request erasure
        </strong>
        of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Object to the processing
        </strong>
        of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Request restriction of processing
        </strong>
        of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
        </li>
        <li>
            You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Request the transfer
        </strong>
        of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Withdraw consent at any time
        </strong>
        where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

            No fee usually required

    </p>
    <p>
        You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

            What we may need from you

    <p>
        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

            Time limit to respond

        We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
