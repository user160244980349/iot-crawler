It applies to personal information we collect through our Cambridge Audio websites, through Cambridge Audio apps and through our connected products (explained in more detail below).
    </p>
    <p>
        By sharing your personal information with us, and by continuing to use our websites, apps and connected products, you confirm that you have read and understood the terms of this privacy policy. We take responsibility for the personal information we collect about you, and we aim to be transparent about how we handle it, and give you control over it.

    Privacy principles
    <p>
        Privacy policies can be complicated. We have tried to make ours as clear and as accessible as possible. To help, we have also summarised how we handle your personal information at Cambridge Audio in our privacy principles below. These principles demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information in the right way and as you would expect it to be handled.
    </p>
    At Cambridge Audio we:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Will only ask for or collect the personal information we need to provide and improve the service, products and experiences our customers expect.
        </li>
        <li>
            Give you control over the personal information we hold about you to ensure it is accurate and reflects your preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure your personal information is always secure and protected.
        </li>
        <li>
            Are fair and transparent about how we use the personal information we hold.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only ever use your personal information for the purpose that you trusted us to use it for.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    What personal information do we collect?
    <p>
        We are not interested in collecting every personal detail about you. Our main reason for collecting your personal information is to provide and improve the service, products and experiences that you and our customers expect from us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal information is defined slightly differently across the world. To guarantee your privacy and the protection of your information, we define it as any information that could be used to identify you or another individual.
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect personal information from you in a number of different ways; you may share that information with us, or we may collect it using other means. In this section, we explain the different ways we collect personal information from you and some ways in which that information will be used. For more detail on how we use your personal information, please see the section titled "How do we use your personal information?".
    </p>
    Information you share with us
    <p>
        We collect personal information that you share with us when you contact us or interact with us through our website, apps, email, phone or otherwise. You can decide not to provide certain information, or ask that any information you have previously shared is removed. If you do so, you may not be able to take full advantage of our products, technology and service.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, you may provide information to us when you contact our customer service teams, place an order, register your warranty, complete a survey, competition or questionnaire, update your preferences and account information, connect through a Cambridge Audio app or rate one of our products on our website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through these interactions you may share with us: your name, address, e-mail address, contact number and payment information. You may also share details of other people; for example, if you have bought a product for that other person. In those circumstances, you will need to check with that person that they are happy for you to share their personal information with us, and for us to use it in accordance with this privacy policy.
    </p>
    Information from Cambridge Audio products and apps
    <p>
        As well as the personal information you share with us about yourself and your Cambridge Audio product, we may collect and handle personal information directly from your Cambridge Audio connected products and Cambridge Audio apps. A connected product is a Cambridge Audio product that is “smart”, internet enabled or operated through a Cambridge Audio app.
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect data from your device to allow us to improve our products. All data is stored securely in the European Union and only handled by us. We do not pass any data to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect data for the following uses:
    </p>
    <p>
        Software update: To provide software upgrades to your devices we use the unit ID and model number to select what software the device should be running. We also aggregate upgrade data to allow us to monitor the update to software updates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Crash reports: These allow us to improve the software on the units by understanding when, how and how often the software crashes. As well as looking at aggregated data, we will look at individual crash reports to fix specific bugs, or in response to customer support queries. The crash data includes information on what the device is doing just before the crash and other UPnP devices on the network.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usage data: This includes what sources you use for how long, but not what you are playing, and various settings of the device (for example: language, network standby mode). This data is aggregated to allow us to understand how our products are used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of our connected products may not be able to operate without collecting location information, or other personal information, and so by registering for the app and using a connected product you agree to this use of the information.
    </p>
    <p>
        From time to time, Cambridge Audio may aggregate and/or anonymize any information collected through the services so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate/Anonymous Information”). We may use Aggregate/Anonymous Information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes.
    </p>
    Information from your online interactions
    <p>
        We collect and handle information from all visitors to our websites, whether you actively provide us with that information or merely browse our websites. The information we collect includes the internet protocol (IP) address of the device you are using, the browser software you use, your operating system, the date and time of access, the internet address of the website from which you link through to our website and information on how you use our websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use this information so that we can see how long our websites take to load, how they are used, the number of visitors to the different sections of our websites, and what information visitors look at most.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also collect and handle information about how you engage with our promotional campaigns and advertising online, outside of our own websites (for example, on Google, YouTube or on social media).
    </p>
    <p>
        That information is, predominantly, collected through our use of cookies and similar technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain features of our services make it possible for you to share comments publicly with other users. Any information that you submit through such features is not confidential, and Cambridge Audio may use it for any purpose (including in testimonials or other marketing materials). For example, if you submit a product review on one of our sites, we may display your review (along with the name provided, if any) on other Cambridge Audio websites and on third-party websites
    </p>
    <p>
        From time to time, Cambridge Audio may aggregate and/or anonymize any information collected through the services so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate/Anonymous Information”). We may use Aggregate/Anonymous Information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes.
    </p>
    Cookies
    <p>
        When you use our websites we may also use information collected by cookies. "Cookies" are small text files that websites save onto your device via your web browser. They’ve been around since the mid-1990’s and are one of the most widely used technologies on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some cookies that we use will collect personal information about you. Any personal information that is collected will be used in accordance with this privacy policy. By continuing to use our websites, you accept that cookies may be set on your device.

    </p>
    Email Communications
    <p>
        As a user of our products or services, we will send you communications by e-mail.
    </p>
    <p>
        As long as you are happy for us to do so, we would also like to keep you posted on anything that's happening at Cambridge Audio which we think you might like to know about; whether it’s our latest product announcements, owner offers or upcoming events, we want to make sure you’re happy with the communications you receive from us. You can find out how to update or change whether you would like to hear from us, or stop us contacting you, in the section below titled ‘How can you change the way that we contact you?'
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect information about how you engage with our e-mails; including whether they are delivered to you, whether you open them, whether you choose to learn more about what's happening at Cambridge Audio (for example, by clicking on a link in our e-mail) and if you ask us not to contact you anymore (by clicking on the unsubscribe option included in all our e-mail correspondence).
    </p>
    <p>
        We use that information by itself and in combination with our customer record (the information you share with us) to make sure that we stop sending you support or marketing communications when you ask us to. We also use it to make our e-mails as interesting as possible by providing you with content and experiences that we think you may be interested in based on how you have engaged with our previous e-mails; you have the right to object to our use of your information for this purpose (see the section below titled 'Your controls and choices').
    </p>
    <p>
        We use the 3rd party company MailChimp to send and manage information emails that we send to you. The collected information is transferred to MailChimp and processed by MailChimp and certain of MailChimp’s sub-processors.
    </p>
    <p>
        MailChimp’s Privacy Policy can be reviewed at

    Social Media
    <p>
        We love interacting with you on social media. You may use social media to contact us about your Cambridge Audio products, or to let people know what you think about your Cambridge Audio product. We review publicly available social media and online sites to get a better understanding of what people are saying about us, and our products, technology and services and to assist consumers who prefer to contact us through social media.
    </p>
    <p>
        The information we collect from social media and online sites sometimes includes personal information that has been put online and is publicly available. We make sure any information we use is properly credited to its source or is made anonymous.
    </p>
    <p>
        These online and social media sites may have their own privacy policies explaining how they use and share your personal information. You should carefully review those privacy policies before you use these sites to make sure that you are happy with how your personal information is being collected and shared.

That information is used to determine whether a transaction could be fraudulent. One of the third parties we use to help us detect and prevent fraudulent transactions is a service called Braintree Payments (a PayPal service); they are responsible for their use of your personal information and will use it for the purposes set out in their privacy policy
        <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/en-gb/legal/braintree-privacy-policy">

        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We will also share your personal information if we are required to do so by law, including in response to a legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or to comply with other national, state, provincial or local laws.
    </p>
    <p>
        We take responsibility for the personal information that you share with us and require those third parties with whom we share your personal information to apply the same level of privacy protection as is contained in this privacy policy.

    Interaction of connected products with third party products
    <p>
        We have added functionality to some of our connected products which allows your Cambridge Audio product to interact with certain third-party services.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to allow your Cambridge Audio device to interact with a third-party product (e.g. Spotify), certain information (including potentially personal information) will need to be shared with the third party product and the relevant third party provider. Generally, we will need to share a unique reference number to connect the two products, and information about your product and how you use it. We only share the minimum amount of personal information that we need to, to enable the two products to interact (e.g., to display your recently-played Spotify playlist within Cambridge Audio connected products and mobile applications). Details of how the third party uses your personal information (as well as any personal information which it collects through its own product) are set out in the third party's privacy policy. You should carefully review third parties' privacy policies before using their products, and before connecting them with your Cambridge Audio product. You can stop your Cambridge Audio connected product from sharing information with the third-party product by disabling the connection between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to find out more about what information is shared between your Cambridge Audio product, and a third party product, please email us at

        The use of your personal information may be necessary to perform the agreement you have with us. For example, to complete your purchase of a product, to register and maintain your account, to help with delivery issues, to handle returns, and to make sure that your product performs its basic functions in a secure way or to respond to your requests.
    </p>

    How do we protect your personal information?
    <p>
        We are committed to protecting your personal information. We use appropriate technical and organisational measures, including encryption, to protect your personal information and privacy, and review those regularly. We protect your personal information using a combination of physical and IT security controls, including access controls that restrict and manage the way in which your personal information and data is processed, managed and handled. However, no method of transmission over the internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to, through, or on our services or via the Internet and that any such transmission is at your own risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also ensure that our staff are adequately trained in protecting your personal information. Our procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we share your personal information with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the unlikely event that we do suffer a security breach which compromises our protection of your personal information and we need to let you know about it, we will do so.
    </p>
    Data transfers, storage and the global handling of your personal information
    <p>
        Cambridge Audio is headquartered in the United Kingdom (UK).
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect personal information in the country in which you live. We then host and store that information in the European Economic Area (EEA). Those third parties that we share your personal information with may handle or transfer your personal information outside of the UK, and outside of the EEA, to other countries in which they have facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will make sure that both any transfer of your personal information by us or by the third parties that we share your personal information with, and our handling of your personal information, complies with those laws which apply to us. In any case, our transfer, storage and handling of your personal information will continue to be governed by this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        By submitting your personal information to us, and by using our websites, apps or connected products, you agree to us transferring, storing and handling your personal information in this way.
    </p>
    Links to third party websites
    <p>
        We may provide links to other websites which are not operated and controlled by Cambridge Audio.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have no control over and are not responsible for the content of those sites or how the third parties responsible for them collect and use your personal information. We do not endorse or make any representations about third party websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third party websites may have their own privacy policies explaining how they use and share your personal information. You should carefully review those privacy policies before you use these websites to make sure that you are happy with how your personal information is being collected and shared.
    </p>

    What is a cookie?
    <p>
        A cookie is a small text file, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. There are various types of cookies which perform different functions, such as remembering which items you have placed in your shopping basket or recording your browsing habits. The information recorded by the cookie is retrieved on the user's next visit to the site.

    How we use cookies
    <p>
        Many cookies on our websites perform essential functions; for example, remembering which items you have placed in your shopping basket.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other cookies are not essential, but they help us understand how our websites are used by visitors, so that we can improve what we do online. We use Web Analytics tools for this. They look at things like how long our websites take to load, how they are used, and what information visitors to our sites look at most. They also help identify any parts of our websites that aren't working as well as they should - so we can fix things and make our websites better for you and other users.
    </p>
    <p>
        A third type of cookie lets us know how well our online advertising works, and where we should place our online advertisements. These cookies let us know if one of our advertisements on another website like Google or Yahoo has sent a visitor to our website.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also use cookies to help us reach people who are more interested in Cambridge Audio products. So if you visit a Cambridge Audio website you may see our advertisements on other sites. This is known as remarketing or behavioural advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not link information collected from cookies with any records we may have of you as a customer of Cambridge Audio.
    </p>
    How to manage cookies
    <p>
        Most web browsers will accept cookies, but if you would rather that we did not collect data in this way you can choose to accept all or some or reject cookies in your browser's privacy settings. Rejecting all cookies means that certain features cannot then be provided to you and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the website's features and you may be prevented from completing your purchase online. Each browser is different so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

    <p>
        On cambridgeaudio.com, cookies record information about your online preferences, remember information about you when you visit our site and compile statistical reports on website activity. Some cookies are used that are essential in order to provide our services to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the course of any visit, your navigation through the site is recorded by a cookie that is downloaded to your device. The information recorded is retrieved on a repeat visit to the site by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
