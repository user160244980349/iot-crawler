    collect from you when you use the Livin website, social media and any electronic methods of collection we may
    utilise from time to time (such as mobile applications).
</p>
<p>
    We provide notice on our website (or, if applicable, a mobile application) in the event that we make any
    modifications that substantially change your rights under this policy.
</p>
<p>
    The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (‘
    <strong>
        Privacy Act
    </strong>
    ’), and the Australian Privacy Principles (‘
    <strong>
        APP

<h2>
    COLLECTION
</h2>
<h3>
    TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED
</h3>
<p>
    We may collect and hold personal information about you, that is, information that can identify you, and is relevant
    to providing you with the services you are seeking. This can include your name, date of birth, contact details
    (including address, email address, phone number), financial information (such as credit card or bank account
    numbers) and information about how you use our products and services.
</p>
<p>
    This is not an exhaustive list. We may need to collect additional information about you from time to time to provide
    products or services to you.
</p>
<p>
    You might also need to provide us with personal information about other individuals (e.g. your authorised
    representatives). If so, we rely on you to inform those individuals that you are providing their personal
    information to us and to advise them about this policy.
</p>
<h3>
    PURPOSE OF COLLECTION
</h3>
<p>
    The type of personal information that we collect and hold about you depends on your interaction with us. Generally,
    we will collect, use and hold your personal information for the purposes of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        providing products or services to you or someone else you know;
    </li>
    <li>
        issuing tax invoices for the products or services we may provide to you from time to time;
    </li>
    <li>
        providing you with information about other services that we, our related entities and other organisations that
        we have affiliations with, offer that may be of interest to you;
    </li>
    <li>
        facilitating our internal business operations, including the fulfilment of any legal requirements; and
    </li>
    <li>
        analysing our services and customer needs with a view to developing new or improved services.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    METHOD OF COLLECTION
</h3>
<p>
    Personal information will generally be collected directly from you either by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        providing us with ‘your story’ relating to mental health which could be showcased on the Livin website or in the
        Livin newsletter;
    </li>
    <li>
        you paying fees owed by you to us or our clients using third party payment systems or other electronic payment
        platforms we may utilise from time to time; or
    </li>
    <li>
        through the use of any of our standard forms (such as when you enter into an agreement with us, contact us with
        a query or request or submit your details through our website or by email).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We may also collect information other than directly from you where it is unreasonable or impractical to not do so,
    for example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        from third parties such as our related entities, business partners, or your representatives;
    </li>
    <li>
        from publicly available sources of information;
    </li>
    <li>
        from our records of how you use our services; and
    </li>
    <li>
        from the third parties we list in the section of this policy with the heading ‘Use and disclosure’.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We will usually notify you in advance when we indirectly collect information, or where that is not possible, as soon
    as reasonably practicable after the information has been collected.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose not to provide certain information about you, we may not be able to provide you with the products or
    services you require, or the level of service on which we pride ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    If the personal information you provide to us is incomplete or inaccurate, we may be unable to provide you, or
    someone else you know, with the products or services you, or they, are seeking.
</p>
<p>
    Our website and credit card security transactions are the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) ensuring your
    privacy and security which encrypts your information as it is transmitted over the internet. The encryption
    scrambles details such as your credit card number, billing details and delivery address so that generally, other
    computers are unable to decipher the information ensuring privacy and security.
</p>

<h2>
    USE AND DISCLOSURE
</h2>
<p>
    Generally, we only use or disclose personal information about you for the purposes for which it was collected (as
    set out above) or for purposes which are directly related to one or more of our functions and activities. We may
    disclose personal information about you to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        third party product or service providers, who assist us in operating our business (including for the purposes of
        collecting payment and assisting us in providing you with the products and/or services that you have requested
        or have expressed an interest), and these service providers may not be required to comply with our privacy
        policy;
    </li>
    <li>
        our related entities and other organisations with whom we have affiliations so that those organisations may
        provide you with information about services and various promotions;
    </li>
    <li>
        a third party where it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process. In the
        event that we are required to release your data, we will provide you with notice unless prohibited by a valid
        legal process;
    </li>
    <li>
        a third party if it is necessary and permitted by law in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of
        assets or reorganisation of our company; and
    </li>
    <li>
        community posts, contests and surveys where you direct your information to be used for this purpose.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We may share your information if you direct us to share your data with other parties. Such third-parties are then
    responsible for the privacy of the shared information. You can revoke your consent to share with the third party at
    any time by contacting us.
</p>
<p>
    We are not likely to disclose your personal information to overseas recipients. However, in the course of providing
    our goods and services it may become necessary or desirable to disclose personal information to overseas recipients.
    The countries in which these overseas recipients may be located will depend on the individual circumstances of the
    relevant matter and it is not practicable to specify them in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>
    INTERNATIONAL USERS
</h3>
<p>
    In some circumstances, we may collect personal information from you which may be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        subject to local, regional or international privacy or data protection laws in jurisdictions other than
        Australia (‘
        <strong>
            International Law
        </strong>
        ’); and/or
    </li>
    <li>
        deemed by International Law specifically in relation to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (‘
        <strong>
            Data Protection Law
        </strong>
        ’) to constitute ‘sensitive information’.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Data Protection Law recognises that some categories of personal information are more sensitive. Sensitive
    information can include information about a person’s health, race, ethnic origin, political opinions criminal
    history, financial position, sex life, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. If you contact us, you may choose
    to provide details of a sensitive nature. We will only use this information in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        For the purposes of dealing with your enquiry;
    </li>
    <li>
        We will not pass on your details to anyone else without your express permission except in exceptional
        circumstances. Examples of this might include anyone reporting serious self-harm or posing a threat to others or
        children contacting us and sharing serious issues such as physical abuse or exploitation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Where you have given us your express consent or otherwise clearly indicated to us that you are happy for us to
        share your story, then we may publish it on our website or in other media.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the instances where International Law requires more restrictive information handling practices than the practices
    set out in this Privacy Policy specifically in relation to Data Protection Law we will ensure that we have
    appropriate controls in place to secure your information by adjusting our information handling practices in your
    jurisdiction to comply with International Law.
</p>
<p>
    To the extent permitted or required under International Law, you consent to us using and disclosing your personal
    information (including in jurisdictions where it is deemed sensitive information) for the purpose for which it was
    collected, unless you subsequently consent to us using and disclosing your information for another purpose as
    described in further detail above
</p>
<p>
    When we disclose personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, it may be accessed from, transferred
    to, and/or stored outside the country in which you are located and outside of Australia. The data protection laws in
    that country may be of a lower standard than those in your own country. We will, in all circumstances, safeguard the
    personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    Livin has networks, databases, servers, systems, support and helpdesks around the world. We collaborate with third
    parties like cloud hosting services, suppliers and technology support located around the world to serve the needs of
    our business, workforce and customers. We take appropriate steps to ensure that personal information is processed,
    secured and transferred according to applicable law. In some cases, we may need to disclose or transfer your
    personal information within Livin or to third parties in areas outside of your home country, including to countries
    that have not been declared adequate for the purposes of data protection by the European Commission.
</p>
<p>
    The areas in which these recipients are located will vary from time to time, but include the United States, Europe,
    Canada, Asia (including Australia and India), and other countries where Livin has a presence or uses contractors.
</p>
<p>
    When we transfer personal information internationally, we put in place safeguards in accordance with applicable law
    (including Articles 44 to 50 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation). If you would like to know more about our
    data transfer practices and obtain copies of any relevant safeguarding measures, please contact our privacy team,
    our contact details are noted below.
</p>
<h2>
    HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR DIRECT MARKETING
</h2>
<p>
    We may also use your information so that we, our related entities, and other business partners can promote and
    market products, services and special offers that we think will be of interest to you (which may include products,
    services and offers provided by a third party). This marketing may be carried out in a variety of ways (including by
    email, SMS/MMS, or social media) and may continue after you cease acquiring any products or services from us until
    you opt-out by contacting us using the contact details set out in the Contact section of this policy.
</p>
<p>

    details, for your added protection. The security of your personal information is important to us. We take all
    reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is stored safely to protect it from misuse, loss,
    interference, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
</p>
<p>
    If we no longer need your personal information for the purposes for which it was collected or for purposes which are
    directly related to one or more of our functions and activities, we will take reasonable steps to securely destroy
    it or permanently remove all identifying features from that information. This obligation is subject to any legal
    requirement or Court order to retain the information.
