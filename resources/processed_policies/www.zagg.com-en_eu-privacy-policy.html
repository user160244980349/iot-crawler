        Sharing information with third parties
    </p>
    <p>
        Save as noted elsewhere in this Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy (e.g. in relation to ZAGG merging with or being acquired by another organisation, or upon a sale of its assets), ZAGG will never sell any information about you to anyone outside of its group. We do not share, sell or rent to other third parties any information that you provide to us, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy. We do not link personally identifiable information with aggregate information.
    </p>
    <p>
        We share your information with selected recipients:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We are part of a larger company and we will share your personal information with the members of our group, including ZAGG Inc. which is based in the United States, because we rely on them to provide us with various services, including data storage and other information technology services, as well as assisting us with fulfilling your order (e.g. for the purpose of tracking sales).
        </li>
        <li>
            We engage third parties to perform services in connection with the operation of our business. Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customisation, order fulfilment and shipping, marketing and promotional material distribution, website evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. We need to share personal information with these third parties so that they can perform these services, however, we limit the personal information that we give to them and authorise them to use this information only for the purpose of performing those services.
        </li>
        <li>
            In proceeding with your online credit card order, both your name and address and those of the delivery name and address (if different) will be checked using third parties.
        </li>
        <li>
            We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our agents, including agencies or third-party vendors so that they can provide marketing analysis and consult on advertising strategies. This information does not identify individual users. We also share non-personal information, such as the number of users who visited the website during a specific time period or who purchased a specific product through the website, with our marketing partners, advertisers and others from time to time. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.
        </li>
        <li>
            We release your information to law enforcement agencies, public authorities or other organisations if we believe in good faith that: (1) the law or legal process requires it; (2) such disclosure is necessary for the detection, prevention or to otherwise address security, fraud or technical issues; (3) if we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or (4) we need to protect our rights, property or safety, that of our users, a third party or the public as required or permitted by law (exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction).
        </li>
        <li>
            As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, sale of all or a portion of our assets or buying online stores or other assets. In such transactions, information about customers will likely be transferred.
        </li>
        <li>
            The data that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It will also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. Where a transfer of information involves a transfer outside the EEA, such information will be transferred to, and stored at/processed in the United States by our affiliates or service providers we rely on to provide you with our goods and services, under the Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses), pursuant to Decision 2010/87/EU.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <a>
    </a>
    <p>
        How long we store your information
    </p>
    <p>
        We will retain your information for as long as we are required by law to do so, and more in particular as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you have an account with us, and use these to make orders, for 7 years after your last purchase; and
        </li>
        <li>
            your electronic identifiers for maximum 2 years (see the “Cookies Policy” section of this Privacy Policy).
        </li>
    </ul>

    </a>
    <p>
        How we protect your information
    </p>
    <p>
        We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personally identifiable information. Your personally identifiable information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personally identifiable information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We do not store any credit card or payment information.
    </p>
    <p>
        While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. You can help protect your information by creating a strong password to access your online account and by accessing your account only through a personal computer or device, as opposed to public computers or means.

        Do not track notice
    </p>
    <p>
        ZAGG does not track its website users over time and across third party websites or online services, and, therefore, does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third-party sites, software or mobile apps do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, you should set your browser settings so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know that you do not want to be tracked. ZAGG does not knowingly permit third parties to collect any personal information from our site unless you directly provide it to us and we provide it to them with your consent.
    </p>

    </a>
    <p>
        Third party links
    </p>
    <p>
        In an attempt to provide you with increased value, in some places we include third party links on our site or through our applications. These third party linked sites and applications have separate and independent privacy or cookie policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites and applications. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our sites and applications and welcome any feedback about these linked sites and applications (including if a specific link or application does not work).

        Children’s privacy
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are under 16 you should surf ZAGG.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Although ZAGG does not specifically direct its website, catalogs, or e-mails to children, we strive to provide children with as much customer service as possible without violating their privacy rights. For their protection, ZAGG asks that anyone under 16 years of age not attempt to register with ZAGG or otherwise provide us with any personally identifiable information without the consent of a parent or legal guardian.
