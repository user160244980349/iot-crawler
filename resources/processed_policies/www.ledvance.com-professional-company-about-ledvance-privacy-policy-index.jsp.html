            1. Scope of processing personal data
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, we only process the personal data of our users to the extent necessary in order to provide a functioning website with our content and services. The processing of personal data regularly only takes place with the consent of the user. Exceptions include cases where prior consent technically cannot be obtained and where the processing of the data is permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            2. Legal basis for data processing
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis to obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of their data.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract of which the data subject is party, Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it is necessary to process personal data in order to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        If vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. d GDPR serves as the legal basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the processing of data is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or that of a third party, and the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the interest of the former, Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR will serve as the legal basis for the processing of data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            3. Data removal and storage duration
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The personal data of the data subject will be erased or restricted as soon as the purpose of its storage has been accomplished. Additional storage may occur if it was provided for by the European or national legislator within the EU regulations, law, or other relevant regulations to which the data controller is subject. Restriction or erasure of the data also takes place when the storage period stipulated by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need to prolong the storage of the data for the purpose of concluding or fulfilling the respective contract.
    </p>
    <p>
        When your personal data is processed, you are subsequently a data subject in the sense of the GDPR and have the following rights:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            1. Right to information
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You may request from the data controller to confirm whether your personal data is processed by them.
    </p>
    <p>
        If such processing is the case, you can request the following information from the data controller:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. The purpose for which the personal data is processed;
        <br/>
        2. The categories of personal data being processed;
        <br/>
        3. The recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data relating to you have been disclosed or are still being disclosed;
        <br/>
        4. The planned duration of the storage of your personal data or, if specific information is not available, criteria for determining the duration of storage;
        <br/>
        5. The existence of a right to rectification or erasure of personal data concerning you, a right to restriction of processing by the data controller or a right to object to such processing;
        <br/>
        6. The existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority;
        <br/>
        7. All available information on the source of the data if the personal data is not collected from the data subject;
        <br/>
        8. The existence of automated decision-making including profiling under Article 22 para. 1 and para. 4 GDPR and, in certain cases, meaningful information about the data processing system involved, and the scope and intended result of such processing on the data subject.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to request information on whether your personal data will be transmitted to a third country or an international organisation. In this context, you can then request for the appropriate guarantees in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR in connection with the transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            2. Right to rectification
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You have a right to rectification and/or completion of the data controller, if your processed personal data is incorrect or incomplete. The data controller must correct the data without delay
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            3. Right to the restriction of processing
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You may request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you challenge the correctness of your personal data for a period of time that enables the data controller to verify the accuracy of your personal data;
        </li>
        <li>
            The processing is unlawful, and you refuse the erasure of the personal data and instead demand the restriction of the use of the personal data;
        </li>
        <li>
            The representative no longer needs the personal data for the purpose of processing, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims; or
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have objected to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR and it is not yet certain whether the legitimate reasons of the data controller outweigh your reasons.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If the processing of personal data concerning you has been restricted, this data may – with the exception of data storage – only be used with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest, interest to the Union, or a Member State.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the processing has been restricted according to the beforementioned conditions, you will be informed by the data controller before the restriction is lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            4. Right to erasure
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        a) Obligation to erase
    </p>
    <p>
        If you request from the data controller to delete your personal data with immediate effect, they are required to do so immediately given that one of the following applies:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Personal data concerning you is no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or processed.
        <br/>
        2. You revoke your consent, to which the processing is allowed pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR and there is no other legal basis for processing the data
        <br/>
        3. According to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR you object to the processing of the data given that the processing of the data is justified by a legitimate interest, or you object pursuant to Art. 21 para. 2 GDPR.
        <br/>
        4. Your personal data has been processed unlawfully.
        <br/>
        5. The act of deleting your personal data will invoke a legal obligation under the Union law or the law of the Member States to which the data controller is subject.
        <br/>
        6. Your personal data was collected in relation to information business services offered pursuant to Art. 8 para. 1 GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        b) Information to third parties
    </p>
    <p>
        If the data controller has made your personal data public and has to delete the data pursuant to Art. 17 para. 1 GDPR, they shall take appropriate measures, including technical means, to inform data processors who process the personal data, that a request has been made to delete all links to such personal data or copies or replications of the personal data, taking into account available technology and implementation costs to execute the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        c) Exceptions
    </p>
    <p>
        The right to deletion does not exist if the processing is necessary
    </p>
    <p>
        1. to exercise the right to freedom of speech and information;
        <br/>
        2. to fulfill a legal obligation required by the law of the Union or of the Member States to which the representative is subject, or to perform a task of public interest or in the exercise of public authority delegated to the representative;
        <br/>
        3. for reasons of public interest in the field of public health pursuant to Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h and i and Art. 9 para. 3 GDPR;
        <br/>
        4. for archival purposes of public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 para. 1 GDPR, to the extent that the law referred to in subparagraph (a) is likely to render impossible or seriously affect the achievement of the objectives of that processing, or
        <br/>
        5. to enforce, exercise or defend legal claims.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            5. Right to information
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have the right of rectification, erasure or restriction of processing over the data controller, they are obliged to notify all recipients to whom your personal data have been disclosed of the correction or erasure of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves to be impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        You reserve the right to be informed about the recipients of your data by the data controller.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            6. Right to data portability
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to receive your personal data given to the data controller in a structured, standard and machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to transfer this data to another person without hindrance by the data controller who was initially given the data, given that
    </p>
    <p>
        1. 1. the processing is based on a consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR or on a contract in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. b GDPR and
    </p>
    <p>
        2. the processing is done by automated means.
    </p>
    <p>
        In exercising this right, you also have the right to maintain that your personal data relating to you are transmitted directly from one person to another, insofar as this is technically feasible. Freedoms and rights of other persons shall not be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
        The right to data portability does not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority delegated to the data controller.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            7. Right to object
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Subjective to your situation, you have, at any time, the right to object against the processing of your personal data pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. e or f GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data controller will no longer process the personal data concerning you unless he can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the purpose of enforcing, exercising or defending legal claims.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the personal data relating to you are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data in regard to such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with direct mail.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless of Directive 2002/58/EG, you have the option, in the context of the use of information society services, to exercise your right to object to automated procedures that use technical specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            8. Right to revoke the data protection consent declaration
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The revocation of consent does not affect the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            9. Automated decision on a case-by-case basis, including profiling
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right not to subject to a decision based solely on automated processing – including profiling – that will have legal effect or affect you in a similar manner. This does not apply if the decision
    </p>
    <p>
        1. is required for the conclusion or execution of a contract between you and the data controller,
        <br/>
        2. is permitted by the Union or Member State legislation to which the data controller is subject, and where such legislation contains appropriate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or
        <br/>
        3. with your expressed consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, these decisions must not be based on special categories of personal data under Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR, unless Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a or g GDPR applies and reasonable measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        With regard to the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the data controller shall take appropriate measures to uphold your rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests, including the right to obtain assistance from the data controller or their representative, to express your opinion on the matter, and to contest the decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            10. Right to complain to a supervisory authority
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you shall have the right to complain to a supervisory authority, in the Member State of their residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement, if you believe that the processing of the personal data concerning you violates the GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been submitted shall inform the complainant of the status and results of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Art. 78 GDPR.

            1. Description and scope of data processing
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and relevant information from the computer system of the calling device.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following data is collected:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Browser type and version used
        </li>
        <li>
            The user's operating system
        </li>
        <li>
            The user’s internet service provider
        </li>
        <li>
            The IP address of the user
        </li>
        <li>
            Date and time of access
        </li>
        <li>
            Web pages from which the user’s system accessed our website
        </li>
        <li>
            Web pages accessed by the user’s system through our website
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is stored in the log files of our system. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            2. Purpose of data processing
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary for the delivery of the website to the computer of the user. For this purpose, the user’s IP address must be kept for the duration of the session.
    </p>
    <p>
        The storage in logfiles is done to ensure the functionality of the website. The data is also used to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our IT systems. An analysis of the data for marketing purposes does not take place.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the aforementioned purposes, our legitimate interest lies in the processing of data in compliance with Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            3. Legal basis for data processing
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and logfiles is Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            4. Duration of storage
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. The session is complete when the collection of data for the provision of the website is accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the data is stored in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage beyond this is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or alienated so that an assignment of the calling client is not possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            5. Objection and removal
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The collection of data for the provision of the website as well as the storage of data in log files are essential for the operation of the website. Therefore, the user may not object to the aforementioned processes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
            2. Purpose of data processing
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The collection of the user's Email address serves the purpose to deliver the newsletter to the recipient.
    </p>
    <p>
        The collection of additional personal data as part of the registration process serves the purpose to prevent misuse of the services or the Email address used.

        <strong>
            3. Legal basis for data processing

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            4. Duration of storage
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. The user's Email address will therefore be stored as long as the newsletter subscription is active.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other personal data collected in the course of the registration process is generally deleted after a period of seven days.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            5. Objection and removal
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The subscription for the newsletter can be cancelled by the data subject at any time. For this purpose, every newsletter contains an opt-out link.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through this, it is also possible to revoke the consent to the storage of personal data collected during the registration process.

    <p>
        If the user has given consent, the legal basis for processing the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of sending an Email is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If the purpose of the Email contact is to conclude a contract, the additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

        <strong>
            4. Duration of storage
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. For personal data sent by Email, this is the case when the respective conversation with the user has ended. The conversation ends when it can be concluded from the circumstances that the matter in question has been conclusively resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
        The additional personal data collected during the sending process will be deleted after a period of seven days at the latest.

    <p>
        Google Analytics uses cookies and stores them on your device. This allows personal data to be stored and evaluated, in particular the user's activity (in particular which pages have been visited and which elements have been clicked on), device and browser information (in particular the IP address and the operating system), data on the advertisements displayed (in particular which advertisements have been displayed and whether the user has clicked on them) and also data on advertising partners (in particular pseudonymised user IDs).

        The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website will be transmitted to and stored by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, on servers in the United States. However, if IP anonymization is enabled on this online presence, Google will previously truncate your IP address within member states of the European Union or other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a server of Google in the USA and shortened there.
    </p>
    <p>
        On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the activities of the website and to provide further services associated with the use of the website and the Internet use to the operator of the website.

        We use the service provider MailChimp of The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 512 Means Street, Suite 404, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA (Hereinafter referred to as MailChimp) to send our newsletter. MailChimp is a provider for email marketing and enables us to communicate directly with potential customers via email newsletters. If you register for the newsletter, the data you enter when registering for the newsletter will be transferred to MailChimp and stored there. This allows further personal data to be stored and evaluated, in particular the user's activity (in particular which pages have been visited and which elements have been clicked) and device and browser information (in particular the IP address and operating system). MailChimp has signed the Privacy-Shield-Agreement between the European Union and the USA and is certified. MailChimp commits itself to comply with the standards and regulations of the European data protection law. Further information can be found in the following linked entry:

    <p>
        Therefore your data will also be stored by MailChimp. Your data will not be passed on to third parties to receive the newsletter and MailChimp does not have the right to pass on your data. After registration MailChimp will send you an email to confirm your registration. In addition, MailChimp offers various analysis options on how the sent newsletters are opened and used, e.g. how many users an email was sent to, whether emails were rejected and whether users unsubscribed from the list after receiving an email.

        The personal data collected during registration for the newsletter will be used exclusively for sending our newsletter, possibly for invitations to events and, if you are already our customer, for our customer e-mail. Furthermore, subscribers to the newsletter could be informed by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration in this respect, as might be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter offering or changes to the technical conditions.
