For instance, while many areas of our website are free to all users, we do require registration for some services such as identifying manufacturer contacts and accessing sample inspection reports. If you decide to register for these services, or if you request information from us, you will be asked to provide certain information and details, including your name, company, title, country and e-mail address.</p> <p> Our system also logs some basic and generic information about your computer, including its:</p> <p> • IP address (your computer's unique signature)<br> • Operating system (e.g. Windows NT)<br> • Browser software (e.g. Netscape Navigator)</p> <p> We use this information about your computer to perform routine web site maintenance and to generate various aggregate reports for internal analysis, research and monitoring purposes, and to help us develop and enhance our web site and services for our users.</p> <p> <strong>Goodada respects your privacy</strong> <br> We will not sell, trade or rent personally identifiable information about our users to other parties, without our users' consent.</p> <p> We do, however, share certain aggregate information about our users with advertisers, i.e. XX% of site visitors is from North America. This enables us to constantly build a large database of products and suppliers, giving you wider sourcing options.</p> <p> We also reserve the right to disclose user information in special cases. For example, when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be infringing (or threatening to infringe) or who may otherwise be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally), our title, rights, interests or property, or those of other web site users, or of anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve the right to disclose, without notice to you, personal information in response to a subpoena or other judicial order or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by any law, regulation or listing requirement, or by any stock/securities exchange, governmental or regulatory authority.</p> <p> <strong>Use of information</strong> <br> We may use the information you provide to respond to your requests for additional information, to contact you, if necessary, to service your account or for other administrative purposes. We may also access your information to resolve disputes, to troubleshoot problems, to enforce agreements between us, or for marketing purposes. In addition, for certain transactions, our system may use your transaction details to automate and to streamline your transaction by checking for electronic data compliance, providing reporting features, and transferring data from previous forms to those of the current transaction.</p> <p> We may also use the information you provide for certain mailing initiatives. For example, you may sometimes receive an invitation to answer surveys or try out new products and services from Goodada.
