        This Privacy Policy applies when you access, visit, use, or submit information through any of our websites, equipment interfaces, mobile and desktop or device applications, or other interactive features or online services owned or operated by Nautilus, Inc., through our various
        <a href="http://www.nautilusinc.com/brands/">
            brands
        </a>
        or a wholly owned subsidiary (collectively, "Nautilus") and that post a link to or include this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing, visiting, using, or submitting information to the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service. Please review our
        <a href="https://www.nautilus.com/terms-of-use.html">

    </p>
    <h2>
        WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER?
    </h2>
    <p>
        We may collect information from you directly, automatically when you visit the Service, and sometimes from third parties. Some of this information may be considered "personal information" under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual (such as your name, phone number, and email address) to be personal information. We will also treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as "personal information" where required by applicable law. Note that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as aggregating or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as "hash". We will treat de-identified information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. If we combine non-personal information with personal information, then we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h3>
        INFORMATION YOU GIVE US DIRECTLY
    </h3>
    <p>
        We collect information you provide when you interact with us (for example, when you set up accounts, make a purchase, sign up to receive our communications, use a subscription plan, participate in a promotion, or otherwise communicate with us). Such information may include contact information (such as your name, mailing address, and e-mail address), and other information, such as demographic information (for example, your gender and age), and information about your shopping interests and preferences. When you create an account on the Service, we will also require you to provide a user name and password for the account. To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Service, you may choose to provide us with additional information such as weight, age, or logs for sleep, food or exercise patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Service may also allow you to purchase products or subscriptions directly from us, in which case we may ask you to provide payment information (such as a credit or debit card number and other associated card information), as well as shipping and billing information, which may be processed by a third party payment processor. When you make purchases, we will also collect your transaction history.
    </p>
    <h3>
        INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH EQUIPMENT; THIRD PARTY SYNCING
    </h3>
    <p>
        We may collect information through Nautilus exercise equipment interfaces, such as health statistics including speed, heart rate, distance traveled, active minutes or calories burned. We may also collect information about your use of our equipment's workout and entertainment consoles, such as workout history, videos watched, and music stations played. Data collected varies depending on which equipment you use. We may also collect similar information through your devices (such as your phone, tablet, or other fitness tracker or device) using WIFI or Bluetooth technology, when you choose to download or use our application or choose to connect your devices with the Service. Data collected through equipment may also be stored on the equipment itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you choose to connect exercise equipment interfaces or devices with our Service, data collected through your exercise equipment interfaces or your devices may be transferred from your equipment interface or device to our servers or otherwise consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, you may be able to sync, or allow a third party to sync, certain Nautilus equipment with third party applications or software in order to share data collected on the equipment with such third party. We are not responsible for such third parties' use of your shared data. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of those third parties before allowing them to synch with your equipment.
    </p>
    <h3>
        INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY ONLINE
    </h3>
    <p>
        We and our third party business partners (including any third party service providers or third party content, advertising, and analytics providers) may use a variety of technologies, including cookies and web beacons, that automatically or passively collect information whenever you access or interact with the Service ("Usage Information"). For example, like many sites, we use technologies such as "cookies" and "clear gifs" to obtain certain types of information when your browser accesses our Service, or when you are provided the opportunity to complete surveys, participate in a sweepstakes or other incentives, or open or respond to any newsletter or other e-mail. We may also allow our business partners, including ad networks, to use these technologies to serve advertisements, provide other advertising services and/or collect certain information when you visit the Sites or utilize the Service; for additional information, please see the section below titled "

            Third Party Advertising and Analytics and Similar Third Parties
        </a>
        ".
    </p>
    <p>
        Usage Information may include the hardware model, browser, and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Service, the search terms you entered while using the Service, and all areas of the Service that you visit, including the products you view or search for, and your time zone, location information, and mobile network (if applicable), among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving the Service and our products and features. In addition, we may automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone, or other device you may use to access the Service. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device used to access the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        The methods used to collect Usage Information may include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Cookies and Log Files.
            </strong>
            Cookies are small data files placed on a device when it is used to visit the Service or otherwise access our online content. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences, tracking your visits to our web pages, and for displaying offers related to your prior activity on the Service. We may use both session and persistent cookies (which remain on your computer after the browser has been closed).   Also, because information we obtain may be combined, we may still be able to identify your web browser, computer or mobile device when you access the Service even if you disable cookies.

            <strong>
                Web Beacons.
            </strong>
            Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Embedded Scripts.
            </strong>
            An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect Usage Information and similar information for security and fraud detection purposes and to enforce our intellectual property rights.
    </p>
    Location Data
    <p>
        In some cases, for example when you opt-in to collection of location data through our mobile applications, we may directly collect location information through your device. You may be able to turn off the collection of location information through the settings on your device. However, please note that we may still be able to collect or infer your approximate location through other information we collect, such as IP address. In addition, some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Service.
    </p>
    <h3>
        SEND TO A FRIEND FEATURES
    </h3>
    <p>
        You may choose to provide us names or other contact information for a friend to take advantage of a referral or other program, to send them product information or gifts, or to utilize a social feature of the Service. If you send a friend a communication from the Service, the information you provide (names, email addresses, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purposes, unless we obtain consent from that person. If you disclose any personal information relating to other people to us, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h3>

        The Service may permit you to submit or post photos, audio, video, text, files, social media posts, or other content ("
        <strong>
            User Content
        </strong>
        ") through interactive or other features, such as product reviews, ratings, discussion forums, blog comments, gallery posts, or promotional activities ("
        <strong>
            Submission Features
        </strong>
        "). Your submission of User Content is subject to the
        <a href="https://www.nautilus.com/terms-of-use.html">
            Terms of Use
        </a>
        for the Service (including the Product Reviews and User Content and Acceptable Use terms) which give us the right to use your User Content, online or offline, in connection with our advertising, publicity, and promotional activities, and may be published online or offline (including, without limitation, on the Service or any other format currently existing or later developed).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Note that anything you choose to submit or publicly post to the Service may be public.
        </strong>
        Others may access it, use it, and share it. We are not responsible for how others use User Content you submit or post. Personal information, such as your name, user name (from the Service or your social media account), or where you reside, may be publicly displayed with your User Content. In addition, in connection with certain activities, your personal information may be disclosed publicly, for example, being identified as a winner of a sweepstakes or being awarded a prize.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some features that allow users to submit User Content, such as product reviews, are operated by third parties and any content submitted through such feature may be provided directly to the third party and subject to that party’s own privacy policy, as disclosed at the time of submission.
    </p>
    <h3>
        SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Service may permit you to interact with a third party platform (such as Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, or Twitter) and the Service, for example "liking" or "sharing" content from the Service, posting your social media posts to the Service, including a hashtag associated with us in your social media post, or creating an account or registering with the Service using existing login information from a third-party platform ("
        <strong>
            Social Media Features
        </strong>
        "). Also, both we and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and the third-party service. These third-party social networking companies may collect information about your visit to our Service through the Social Media Features we have integrated into the Service. Note that through the Social Media Features, these third party social networking companies may be able to collect certain information about your visits to the Service regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the Social Media Features and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account with the social networking company.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use Social Media Features, your interaction and personal information may be publicly disclosed on the Service and on the third-party platform. If others give us access to their profile, page, or other content on a third-party platform, we may also receive information about you if it is accessible through that content. Your use of Social Media Features is subject to the
        <a href="https://www.nautilus.com/terms-of-use.html">
            Terms of Use
        </a>
        for the Service (including the Product Reviews and User Content and Acceptable Use terms) which give us the right to use your interaction, online or offline, in connection with our advertising, publicity, and promotional activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        The information we collect in connection with Social Media Features is subject to this Privacy Policy; the information the third-party platform collects is subject to the third party’s privacy practices (including whether the third party shares information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices about what is visible to others on the third-party platform).
    </p>
    <h3>
        INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES
    </h3>
    <p>
        We may receive certain information about you from third parties, including business partners and data providers and third party payment processors. If you are on another website and agree to receive information from us, that site will forward your information to us so that we may contact you. We may also receive information about you when you sync our equipment with third party services and applications (such as when you connect a third party service to track your fitness goals) and when we integrate third party features with the Service (such as to provide voice activated coaching or play music for your workouts). If we partner with a third party for a sweepstakes or promotion, your information may be shared in connection with your entry. If you apply for employment with us through a third party website, we may have access to certain information that you submit. We may supplement that information with the information we collect with outside records from other third parties, such as public databases, publicly available social media pages, joint marketing partners, and third parties who enhance the information we have about you. We use this information to respond to your requests, tailor content, offer you products or services that we believe may interest you, enhance our products and services, and for other business purposes. The information collected and stored by third parties is subject solely to the third party’s privacy practices.
    </p>

    EXERCISING YOUR CALIFORNIA ACCESS, DELETION, AND OPT-OUT RIGHTS
    <p>
        California residents have the right to request: (1) that we disclose to you what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, and sell, including the right to request that we provide to you the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you in the prior 12 months ("Right to Know"); (2) that we delete the Personal Information we collect about you ("Right to Delete"); or (3) to opt-out from the sale of Personal Information, all subject to exceptions set forth in the CCPA. More information on each of these rights is below.
    </p>
    Agents
    <p>
        If you are an agent submitting a request on a user’s behalf, please send an email to privacy@nautilus.com with a declaration signed by the individual who is the subject of the request authorizing you to make the request on their behalf. The written permission must state your full legal name, the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request, and needs to be clear about the permission granted. Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. In either case, please also indicate in your email the nature of your request. The consumer’s identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified in order for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided you permission to submit a request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request.
    </p>
    How to Make Request to Know or Request to Delete
    <p>
        If you are a California resident and would like to request information about the Personal Information we have collected about you in the prior 12 months or to request that we delete your information, please contact us at privacy@nautilus.com. You may also call us toll-free at 800-605-3369.
    </p>
    Verifying Requests
    <p>
        Please provide your first and last name, email address you have used to interact with Nautilus, mailing address, and telephone number, which we will use to verify your request. We may ask for additional information as needed to fully verify you or your request.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request.
    </p>
    Other Important Information:
    <p>
        Request to Know
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to have us provide specific pieces of information, we will require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Request to Delete
    </p>
    <p>
        To ensure that we do not delete your personal information in response to a fraudulent request, once you submit the request, we will follow up to confirm that you want your information to be deleted.
    </p>
    RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THE SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
    <p>
