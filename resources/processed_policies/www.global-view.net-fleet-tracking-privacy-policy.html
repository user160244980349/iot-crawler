        Telematics units will track device location by sending GPS coordinates to the Global-View.Net Portal application. We may also determine location by using other data from your mobile device, such as information about wireless networks or cell towers near your device. We use and store information about your location to enable many product features that are dependent upon location tracking. We may also use collected information to troubleshoot software, to conduct data analysis, to do testing, research, and to monitor and analyze usage and activity trends to improve and customize the services.

        As you interact with our services, we collect server logs, which may include information such as device IP address, access dates and times, application pages viewed, app crashes, browser details and other system activities. In addition, we use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Services’ functionality.
