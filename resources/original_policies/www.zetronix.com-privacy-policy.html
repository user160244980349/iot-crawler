</ul>
<p><strong>Advertiser Business Interests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, so that you can be provided with information about unrelated goods and services which we consider may be of interest to you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may contact you about these goods and services by any of the methods that you consented to at the time your information was collected.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a new customer, we will contact you or allow third parties to contact you only when you have provided consent, and only by those means, you provided consent for.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not want us to use your data for ourselves or third-parties, you will have the opportunity to withhold your consent when you provide your details to us on the form on which we collect your data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please be advised that we do not reveal information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may, on occasion, provide them with aggregate statistical information about our visitors such as your area of residence or age group.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Sharing and Disclosure</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated within this policy, or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt-out of having your personal information shared. We will share your information in the following ways.</span></p>
<p><strong>With third-party service providers, agents, or contractors.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We use other companies, agents or contractors (“Service Providers”) to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with providing services to you. For example, we engage Service Providers to process credit card transactions and other payment methods. We may also engage Service Providers to provide services such as marketing, advertising, communications, infrastructure and IT services, to provide customer service, to collect debts, and to analyze and enhance data (including data about users’ interactions with our service). These Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information in order to provide these functions. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services on our behalf to you.</span></p>

Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our services. This data is shared with other Google Services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Google Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.</span></li>

<p><strong>Business Transfers.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy. In such transitions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. In the unlikely event that we or substantially all of our assets are acquired or enter a court proceeding, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that your personal information can continue to be used as set forth in this privacy policy.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical, and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use and modification.

<h3><strong>GDPR Readiness at Zetronix</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2016, the EU Parliament and Council agreed upon the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), first proposed in 2012, to go into effect on May 25, 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR offers a new framework for data protection with increased obligations for organizations. GDPR focuses on protecting personal data and handing control of it back to the subject of the data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been receiving a lot of questions from our Customers, Vendors, Prospects, and Partners. So we’ve provided some more information in the following areas:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer GDPR Roll-Out</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governance Structure and Zetronix’s Data Protection Officer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Mapping</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information Security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Impact Assessments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to Subject Access Requests / Rectification / Deletion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Breach Reporting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies &amp; Privacy Policy Update(s)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who to Contact</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>1. Customer GDPR Roll-Out</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where customers are processing personal data with Zetronix, as this is against third party data sources, we are asking our customers to advise us on the lawful processing condition for using our products/services. This ‘reason’ why will need to be determined by our customer, as they are the Data Controller. </span><strong>Zetronix is the Data Processor who acts under their instruction.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are six lawful processing conditions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compliance with a legal obligation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance of a contract</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legitimate interest</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public interest</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vital interest</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consent</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Governance Structure and Zetronix’s Data Protection Officer</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data privacy is discussed throughout Zetronix with regular presentations to all of our Employees, the Executive Team, and members of our Board of Directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zetronix’s named Data Protection Officer is Daniel Sachs (COO).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Sachs leads the Privacy and Data Compliance initiative, where each Department Head has a core focus on the products Zetronix delivers, helping embed data privacy into operations whilst also monitoring activity on an ongoing basis.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Data Mapping</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zetronix has completed Article 30; our Data Mapping exercise. We know what data we have, where it’s held, how we access it, the classification of the data, records for transfer, and flowcharts to show how it moves between systems, processes and countries.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Information Security</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Operations Team is focused on maintaining an information security program that covers everything you would expect and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes technical security measures (e.g. intrusion, detection, firewalls, monitoring), restricted access to personal data, protection of our physical premises and hard assets, maintaining security measures for our team members (e.g. pre-screening), a data-loss prevention strategy and regular testing of our security posture across our product family: Zetronix.com, Soliur.com</span></p>
<h3><strong>5. Privacy Impact Assessments</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where appropriate, a Privacy Impact Assessment will be completed and evidence gathered, such as copies of privacy notices, a due diligence questionnaire, periodic testing.</span></p>
<h3><strong>6. Responding to Subject Access Requests / Rectification / Deletion</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zetronix has a process in place to manage these requests and sees no issue responding within the new GDPR required timescale of 30 days.</span></p>
<h3><strong>7. Data Breach Reporting</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ICO or Information Commissioner’s Office has a Blog that clears up a lot of myths around data breach reporting. Art. 33 (2) states as a data processor, Zetronix’s obligation is to notify data controllers without undue delay after becoming aware of it. WP29 have provided some guidance on this which states:</span></p>
<p><strong>“The GDPR does not provide an explicit time limit within which the processor must alert the controller, except that it must do so “without undue delay”. Therefore, WP29 recommends an immediate notification by the processor to the controller, with further information about the breach provided in phases as information becomes available. This is important in order to help the controller to meet the requirement of notification to the supervisory authority within 72 hours.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zetronix’s position is, the regulation states without “undue delay”, therefore this is what we will abide by. However, we recognize that for our Customer, the Data Controller, the clock will only start ticking when they become aware there has been an incident.</span></p>
<h3><strong>8. Cookies &amp; Privacy Policy Update(s)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zetronix is happy to protect the privacy of all data subjects across the Globe. We have updated our Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy to provide users with transparency.</span></p>
<h3><strong>9. Who to Contact</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can reach our Compliance team via email for any GDPR related questions at: sales@zetronix.com</span></p>
