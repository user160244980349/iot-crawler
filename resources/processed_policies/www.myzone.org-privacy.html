    <br/>
    When registering your Myzone Device on this Site or via the App, you will be asked to enter information including your name, email address, date of birth, gender, height, weight, phone number and member/employee number (if applicable).

        Your Facilities
        <br/>
        You can register your Myzone Device for use at a facility (health club, community hub, social hub, school, or employer etc.) by selecting their facility code in your Myzone Device user account. The data shared with the facility depends upon the level of agreement that the facility has entered into with us, as follows:
        <br/>
        <em>
            Level 1
        </em>
        . As you are a member of the facility, they will have your name in their records. They are able to see that you are a Myzone Device user connected to their facility, but we do not share any data about you that Myzone obtains via your use of a Myzone Device with them.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH YOUR FACILITY
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Your facility may upgrade its facility agreement by entering into a data-sharing agreement with us. If they have entered into a data-sharing agreement, they are responsible directly to you for the data that they receive and, if applicable, that they share with other third parties. You are advised of the access level that your facility operates under and you must give explicit consent in the Myzone App to your facility accessing data in accordance with its agreement level. If you do not give explicit consent, your data will not be shared with the facility and this may impact on the services that they can provide to you. The additional agreement levels are:
        <br/>
        <em>
            Level 2
        </em>
        . The facility has advised us that they are based outside of the EU and that it has no EU citizens as members. They can transfer personal data from the Myzone platform to their systems. They can retain personal data on their systems if you were to terminate your Myzone Device user account and are responsible directly to you for the data that they hold.
        <br/>
        <em>
            Level 3
        </em>
        . The facility cannot transfer personal data from the Myzone platform to their systems. If you were to terminate your Myzone Device user account, they will not have access to any personal data.
        <br/>
        <em>
            Level 4
        </em>
        . The facility can transfer personal data from the Myzone platform to their systems. They can retain personal data on their systems if you were to terminate your Myzone Device user account and are responsible directly to you for the data that they hold.
        <br/>
        Individuals connected with facilities are not our employees or agents and you should satisfy yourself that the facility has procedures in place to protect your privacy (and, if applicable, the privacy of any child).
        <br/>
        Any data shared with facilities includes your first name, last name, nickname, Myzone Device ID, phone number, email address, date of birth, gender, resting heart rate, and maximum heart rate.
        <br/>
        Your facility can also access data showing when you have participated in any class activity, the duration of such activity, and the number of calories burnt. In addition, facilities can access the names of your social connections linked with their facility and access the number of “likes” and the number of comments you have made against activities of other Myzone Device users. If you do not explicitly consent to facilities having access to such information you should either not proceed with your Myzone Device registration or should request and use a generic Myzone facility code. The facilities do not have access to any personal biometric data unless you permit them to have such access.

        Distributors
        <br/>
        Our products are sold to facilities through third party distributors. If you decide to purchase a product, in order for you to enter into an agreement with the distributor, and for the distributor to fulfil the agreement for a facility, we may transfer any information that you (a facility) provide to us to the distributor.
        <br/>
        Your distributor may provide support services to you and your facility in your region for which purpose the distributor will enter into a data-sharing agreement with us. If they have entered into a data-sharing agreement, they are responsible directly to you for the data that they receive and, if applicable, that they share with other third parties. You are advised if a distributor requires access and you must give explicit consent in the Myzone App to your distributor accessing data. If you do not give explicit consent, your data will not be shared with the distributor and this may impact on the support services that they can provide to you. The distributor cannot transfer personal data from the Myzone platform to their systems through an API or a data export feature offered by us. If you were to terminate your Myzone Device user account, they will not have access to any personal data.
        <br/>
        Individuals connected with distributors are not our employees or agents and you should satisfy yourself that the distributor has procedures in place to protect your privacy (and, if applicable, the privacy of any child).

            9 How long do we keep your personal data?
        </strong>
    </a>
    <p>
        We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
        <br/>
        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
        <br/>
        We keep information like your exercise or activity data, until you use your account settings to delete the data or your account because we use this data to provide you with your personal statistics and other aspects of the services. We also keep information about you and your use of the services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm,
        <br/>
        If you choose to close your Myzone account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Myzone services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below and please also see the request erasure section below.
        <br/>
        We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if we believe that this is necessary or required to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, protect and/or enforce our rights and to fulfil any instructions not to communicate with you any further.
        <br/>
        We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.
        <br/>
        Information you have shared with others users may remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile and account, and we do not control data that other users have copied out of our Myzone Services to any other devices or storage systems.

    </a>
    <p>
        We have provided you with a means of managing your privacy settings. You can update your default settings in the App and control what and with whom you share your personal information.
        <br/>
        You hereby explicitly consent to the following default settings which are as follows:
        <br/>
        Allow my connections to see “My Moves” data = ON (visible)
        <br/>
        Allow my connections to see “My Photos” = ON (visible)
        <br/>
        Allow my connections to see “My Connections” = ON (visible)
        <br/>
        “Allow me to be viewed as a connection of a connection” = ON (visible)
        <br/>
        <strong>
            You may at any time change your account settings so as to turn any of the settings above to “OFF”
        </strong>
        <br/>
        <strong>
            You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into your account and adjusting your marketing preferences.

            You can at any time delete your account or withdraw your explicit consent by following the guidelines on the App.
        </strong>
        <br/>
        <strong>
            On inactive accounts we will send reminders to you about this but if you do not respond to our reminders then we reserve the right to delete your account (including all data in or relating to your account).

        If you choose to purchase any of our products or services, credit card information will be collected by a third party payment processor which has represented to us that the payment data that you transfer is encrypted (turned into unidentifiable code) by a method known as SSL (secure sockets layer).
        <br/>
        While we take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect data that you submit directly to us, remember that the Internet is a global communications vehicle open to threats, viruses and intrusions from others and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that we will be able to protect your information at all times and in all circumstances.
        <br/>
        We store data on servers that are either owned or leased by us. We rent space for our servers from a dedicated hosting service provider that is compliant with ISO 27001 standards of security. We store our data at Domicilium, based the Isle of Man, British Isles. The Quality and Information Security Management Systems of Domicilium have been approved by Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance (LRQA) to the following Quality and Information Security Management Standards: ISO 9001:2015; ISO/IEC 27001:2013.
        <br/>
        We work hard to keep your data safe. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however. If you have a security-related concern, please contact us at the Myzone contact details provided:

            12 Children’s accounts and Myzone’s collection of information from children
        </strong>
    </a>
    <p>
        We allow you as a parent or guardian to create a Myzone account for a child in your care (your child) that is under the age of 16. A child’s account operates as a sub-account of your Myzone account. Your child can access their account by using the Site or App but with restricted features. You can access your child’s account by using the Site.
        <br/>
        When a parent or guardian creates a Myzone account for their child, you can exercise each of the rights described in the “Your rights” section in connection with the child’s account. This includes the right to access the information that Myzone collected from the child, correct inaccuracies about the child, or delete information collected about a child. In addition to these rights, you can instruct Myzone to stop collecting additional information about your child (e.g. disable their account). As is indicated below, these rights can be exercised by contacting support@myzone.org or, in some cases, using online features that are built into your Myzone online account.
        <br/>
        Your child’s account displays their username, name, “moves” activity, and profile picture. This data is shared with their connections and your facility. If you wish to collect and share your child’s biometric data with a facility, you must explicitly consent to this in your Myzone account. If such consent is given Myzone will collect the information described under the “What information do we collect?” section about your child, and use that information as is described in the “What do we use your information for?” section.
        <br/>
        Throughout the European Union, different member states have implemented or are in the process of implementing, varying ages at which children are deemed capable of giving valid consent to the processing of their personal data, as indicated below:

        When you give the explicit consent described above in respect of a child that is able to provide valid consent, the child must also give their own explicit consent to the processing of their personal data via their Myzone account as they will have attained the age for valid consent.
        <br/>
        Users under 18 years of age are not permitted to upload photos. Users cannot search and locate other users unless the other party is 16 years of age. Parties that are connected to your child’s Myzone account can comment on your child’s “moves” activity. Other chat functions are disabled. In addition, a parent or guardian may disable features enabling their child’s workout to be uploaded to social media sites.
        <br/>
        The parent or guardian of any person aged below 16 years and the child where they are aged from the Age for Valid Consent and 16, are required to explicitly consent to the collection and use of their child's and their own personal data at the time that the parent or guardian registers a Myzone Device for their child. Parents and guardians must communicate this explicit consent through completion of additional steps in their Myzone account. Persons aged from the Age for Valid Consent to 16 must also communicate this explicit consent through completion of additional steps in their Myzone account. Parents and guardians will have complete access to their child’s Myzone account.
        <br/>
        Once the child has attained the age of 16, they are eligible to create and independently manage their own Myzone account.
        <br/>
        Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at;

        Regarding the above legal bases:
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Explicit Consent
        </strong>
        means when you have given your explicit consent, which you may withdraw at any time using your account settings and other tools.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Legitimate Interests
        </strong>
        means that we may process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests or for the legitimate interests of third parties (e.g. Facilities and/or Myzone Group Companies), provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Performance of a Contract with You
        </strong>
        means we may process your personal data for the purposes of our performing a contract with you.
        <br/>
        Myzone may use information about your identity, contact information, profile information, usage of the Myzone System, technical information, order information and your exercise statistics or performance to decide upon what we think you may or may not want or need, or what may or may not be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you. Myzone may use the data you provide to us directly for this purpose along with third party data.
        <br/>
        We generally only send emails and messages such as email marketing to Users or individuals who have previously bought similar products from us and this is in our legitimate interests. We will aim to provide Users with a way out of receiving this marketing when you first purchase our products and in every marketing communication afterwards. We may sometimes send out postal marketing for the purpose of growing our sales which is in our legitimate interests and you can opt out of this by contacting us at: support@myzone.org.
        <br/>
        Where you have not previously bought from us but have registered your details with us (for example by entering a competition or signing up for a newsletter), we will only send you marketing communications if you opted into receiving marketing at the time and given consent which you may withdraw at any time.
        <br/>
        We may also share certain data with third parties in order to show you targeted ads when you visit them. We do this by the use of cookies which capture your visits to our website in accordance with our cookie policy.
        <br/>
        You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into your account and adjusting your marketing preferences.
        <br/>
        Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, or related correspondence, and we will continue to process such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by law.
        <br/>
        We do not conduct any automated decision making. You have the right to:
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Request access
        </strong>
        to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Request correction
        </strong>
        of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Request erasure
        </strong>
        of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Users are able to request the deletion or removal of personal data. Users can email support@myzone.org and we will remove their personal data from all records, including archive records, and disable their account. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Once an account has been deleted, we will not be able to recreate it. It should be noted that we do not know the reasoning behind any period of inactivity on a Myzone account, and we are reluctant to close accounts without the consent of Users. We contact all Users that have had no activity on their account over a period of 24 months to determine if they wish to retain their account. We delete the account if we receive confirmation that account is no longer required. Please note that the removal of such personal data will render the Myzone Device and service inoperable. Also note that content you have shared with others or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have deleted your account or deleted the information from your own account. Please also note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your information will be deleted within 30 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete all of your information, like the data recorded by your Myzone Device and other data stored in our backup systems. This is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data. We may also preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Object to processing
        </strong>
        of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Request restriction of processing
        </strong>
        of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Request the transfer
        </strong>
        of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Users have a right to move their data from one facility to another. However, if the other facility is not a Myzone customer, we will only be able to assist in transferring data if this is technically feasible. If you wish to transfer your account or receive a copy of your data, contact support@myzone.org.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Withdraw consent
        </strong>
        at any time where we are relying on explicit consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your explicit consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your explicit consent.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Editing and Deleting Data
        </strong>
        . By logging into your account and using your account settings, you can change and delete your personal information. For instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your Myzone account if you wish.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Exercising your rights:
        </strong>
        Many of your rights above can be exercised via your account settings and tools to control our use of your personal data. For example, through your account settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the services. If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at: dpo@myzone.org and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.
