        Google's remarketing feature allows us to show our users advertisements based on their interests on our other websites within the Google Ads Network (so-called "Google ads" or ads on other websites). For this purpose, the interaction of the users on our website is analysed in order to be able to show users targeted advertising even after visiting our website on other sites.

        In addition, our website uses further services of the Google Marketing Platform (formerly “Google doubleclick”). These services use cookies to serve ads that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports or to prevent a user from receiving ads multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
        Google uses a cookie ID to record which ads are played in which browser and thus prevents them from being displayed multiple times. In addition, Google can use cookie IDs to track what are known as conversions, i.e. whether a user sees an advertisement and later goes to the advertiser's website and buys something there. According to Google, such cookies do not contain person information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server. We have no influence on the extent and further use of the data collected through the use of this tool by Google. According to Google, through the involvement of this services, Google receives the information that you have accessed the relevant part of our website or clicked on an ad from us. If you are registered with a service of Google, Google can assign the visit to your user account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a chance that the provider will find out and store your IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, the Google cookies allow us to understand whether you are performing certain actions on our website after you have viewed or clicked on one of our ads on Google or on another platform (Conversion Tracking) (“Floodlight”). Google uses this cookie to understand the content with which you have interacted on our web sites so that it can later send you targeted advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can prevent the tracking process by setting your browser software accordingly (e.g. third party cookies disabled), deactivate the cookies for conversion tracking by blocking cookies from the domain www.googleadservices.com in your browser settings, at www.google.com/settings/ads, for interest-based ads of the providers that are part of the About Ads self-regulatory campaign, via the link http://www.aboutads.info/choices or the link http://www.google.com/settings/ads/.

        To improve the comfort and quality of our services, we use conversion tracking and retargeting technology, provided by Adform ApS, Wildersgade 10B, 1, 1408 Copenhagen, Denmark.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adform's Conversion Tracking sets a temporary cookie when a user makes contact via an Adform ad. Users who do not wish to participate in tracking may disable the cookie from Adform via their Internet browser or object to data collection and storage at any time in the future here (https://site.adform.com/datenschutz-opt-out/). Cookies already stored on your computer can be deleted in your browser or deleted by deleting temporary Internet pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        This retargeting technology makes it possible to target those Internet users who have already taken an interest in our website and our products on websites of our partners. The insertion of the advertising material takes place in this instance on the basis of a cookie-based analysis of the previous user behaviour. This is a temporary cookie that expires after 60 days. If you do not want to be shown interest-based advertising by Adform, you may opt out of collecting and storing data for the future here (https://site.adform.com/datenschutz-opt-out/) at any time. For more information about Adform's Privacy Policy, see: https://site.adform.com/datenschutz-opt-out

        The legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR, whereby the improvement in comfort and quality of our online offers justifies our legitimate interest.

            5.3 Facebook Custom Audiences
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our website uses the "Custom Audiences" remarketing feature of Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (hereinafter referred to as "Facebook"). We use Custom Audiences in order to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our websites or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us incorporating a pixel from Facebook into our website, and Facebook matching common factors between our data and their data.
    </p>
    <p>
        This allows users of the website to be shown interest-based advertisements ("Facebook Ads") as part of their visit to the social network Facebook or other websites that also use the process. We are interested in showing you advertisements that are of interest to you in order to make our online offers more interesting to you. The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6(1(1)(f) GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of Custom Audience means your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Facebook server. We have no influence on the extent and further use of the data collected through the use of this tool by Facebook and therefore inform you that according to our knowledge: By integrating Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook receives the information that you have accessed our website or have clicked on an ad from us. If you are registered with a service of Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to your Facebook account. Even if you are not registered with Facebook or have not logged in, there is a chance that the provider will process your IP address and other identifying features. Disabling the "Facebook Custom Audiences" feature is available to logged-in users at https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#.

    </p>
    <p>
        Facebook stores the data collected about you as usage profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or tailor-made website design. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (also for non-logged-in users) for the presentation of needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have a right to object to the formation of these user profiles, whereby you must exercise this right to Facebook.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through the plug-ins we offer you the opportunity to interact with the social networks and other users, so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.

            4. Marketing cookies
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        For the purpose of retargeting/remarketing and for the placement of online advertisements we use so-called marketing cookies from third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Retargeting or remarketing refers to technologies that allow users who have previously visited a certain website to see suitable advertisements even after they have left the website. For this purpose, it is necessary to recognize Internet users beyond their own website, for which cookies from the corresponding service providers are used. In addition, the previous usage behaviour is taken into account. For example, if a user looks at certain products, these or similar products can later be displayed as advertisements on other websites. These are personalised advertisements that are adapted to the needs of individual users. For this personalised advertising, it is not necessary for the user to be identified beyond recognition. The data used for retargeting or remarketing is therefore not merged with other data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marketing cookies may also track user engagement with the ads ultimately shown. This is in order to avoid unwanted duplicate advertising and to track the amount of times ads result in some form of ad conversion (e.g. an ad being clicked on or an actual sale).
    </p>
    <p>
        The legal basis for the processing of personal data through marketing cookies is consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR), You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future, by managing your settings at the very top of this Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use such technologies for the placement of online advertisements. For the placement of the advertisements we use third party providers. Details of the third parties (and their tools) who provide and/or access marketing and targeted cookies are explained below.
    </p>
    <p>
        The companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are required by us to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads. Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“
        <strong>
            DAA
        </strong>
        ”) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“
        <strong>
            NAI
        </strong>
        ”). To learn more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads from them, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants,
        <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">

            https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
        </a>
        . Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services).
    </p>
    <p>
        To opt out of us using your data for Matched Ads, please contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below and specify that you wish to opt out of matched ads. We will request that the applicable party not serve you matched ads based on information we provide to it. Alternatively, you may directly contact the applicable party to opt out.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices).

The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6(1(1)(f) GDPR.

    <p>
        The use of Custom Audience means your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Facebook server. We have no influence on the extent and further use of the data collected through the use of this tool by Facebook and therefore inform you that according to our knowledge: By integrating Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook receives the information that you have accessed our website or have clicked on an ad from us. If you are registered with a service of Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to your Facebook account. Even if you are not registered with Facebook or have not logged in, there is a chance that the provider will process your IP address and other identifying features.
