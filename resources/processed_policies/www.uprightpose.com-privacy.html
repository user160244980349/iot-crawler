    <h3>
        <strong>
            How Do We Collect Personal Data?
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        We collect personal data in the following methods: First, we collect personal data when you register to our services or order our products. We do so by taking the personal data you filled out in our forms, as well as your use of the websites and applications. Then, we collect personal information when we interact with you: when you contact us through our support systems, when you send us emails or when you contact us via phone. We also use the device’s sensors you purchased from us to collect personal data.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>
            What Personal Data Do We Collect?
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        We collect mainly information that relates to your use of our services, which includes: (i) information provided by you when you register to our services or order our products, such as: demographics, your first and last name, your email address, your gender, age, height, weight and approximate location (where the device was bought); (ii) information on why you bought our device; (iii) information relating to your use of the device, which includes the number of hours you sit and move each day, the pain levels you experience, your postures and progress; and (iv) information about your health and wellbeing, which includes habits, work environment, fitness routines and training preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also collect the contents of all correspondence between ourselves and our Customers.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>
            How Do We Process Personal Data?
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        We use your personal data in order to provide you with the services. This is the purpose of collecting the personal data and the main reason for processing. This includes, first and foremost, collecting personal data by the sensors in our end-devices and using it to analyze your current posture and activity and to keep it for future analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also keep your contact information, both to provide you with access to our application, to contact you with notifications about your device, use of the software and new features, as well as to let you know if we believe something was compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
        We process your personal data also in order to create statistical, non-personally identifiable, data which is used to assist us in better understanding of features. This means that we can compare behavior, for example, of different age groups, people living in different locations, or different genders in overall performance of our product. By using this data we can help you use our products and services in a better way.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also process your personal data to understand your device level data, your posture score, your movement levels, and additional technical information including whether you slouched, sat at a smooth angle, had some training, and how you interacted with or without vibrations.
    </p>
    <h3>

We do not, however, comply with mass-surveillance of our end-users, and shall challenge such requirements in courts until resorting all efforts.

        We secure personal information by storing it in industry-grade servers, when information may be encrypted to prevent abuse and misuse.

We make sure that all access to our servers is logged, and in some cases use two-factor-authentication.
