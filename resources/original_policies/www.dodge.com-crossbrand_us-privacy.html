<p>We and our third-party providers use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your browsing activities, and use of the Websites and other Services. We may combine this “usage data” with other personal information we collect about you. We use this usage data to understand how our Services are used, track bugs and errors, provide and improve our Services, verify account credentials, allow logins, track sessions, prevent fraud, and protect our Services, as well as for targeted marketing and advertising, to personalize content and for analytics purposes (see the <i>Your Rights and Choices</i> section below for information about opting-in out of certain uses of your personal information)</p>
<p><b><i>Cookie</i>s.&nbsp;</b>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Website, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities while using our Website. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Some of the Services may not work properly if you disable cookies.</p>
<p><b><i>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</i></b>&nbsp;Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. &nbsp;In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also referred to as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Services to, among other things, track the activities users of our Services, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Services. We and our service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>
<p><b><i>Third-Party Analytics</i></b>. We may use third-party analytics companies, for example <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Google Analytics</a> (see <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en">privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">opt-out</a>) to evaluate use of our Services. We use these tools to help us understand use of, and to improve, our Services, performance, ad campaigns, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (LSOs), to perform their services.</p>
<p><b><i>Do Not Track (DNT)</i>.</b>&nbsp;Our Websites currently do not respond to “do not track” signals. You may, however, disable certain tracking mechanisms in the cookie preference settings of your web browser and opt out of certain third party ad cookies on our websites.</p>
<p><b><i>Preferences</i>.</b>&nbsp; You can opt out of or change your preferences for most third-party cookies and tags on our Websites, by adjusting your cookie settings using our cookie preference manager. In addition, you may block or disable cookies for the device and browser you are using, through your browser settings; however, certain features on our Websites may not be available or function properly if you block or disable cookies.</p>
<h2 id="par-6">6. INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING</h2>
<p>We may work with third-party ad networks, channel partners, measurement services and others (“third-party ad companies”) to personalize content and advertising on our Services, and to manage our advertising on third-party sites, mobile apps and online services. We and these third-party ad companies may use cookies, pixels tags, and other tools (which we may refer to collectively as “targeting cookies”) to collect activity information within our Services (as well as on third-party sites and services), as well as IP address, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs, and other identifiers, and location information (about you and your vehicle); we and these third-party ad companies use this information to provide you more relevant ads and content within our Services and to improve and evaluate the success of such ads and content.<i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>We also may share certain hashed customer list information (such as your email address) with third parties—such as Facebook and Google—so that we can better target ads and content to our users, and others with similar interests, within their services. These third parties use the personal information we provide to help us target ads and to enforce their terms, but we do not permit them to use or share the data we submit with other third-party advertisers.</p>
<p><b>Preferences.</b>You can review or change your preferences for targeting cookies and tags on our Websites by adjusting your cookie settings, which you can access by clicking the “Cookie Settings” link in the footer of our Websites.</p>
<p><b><i>Industry Ad Choice Programs.&nbsp;</i></b>FCA US adheres to Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising. For more information or to opt out of third party advertising cookies and tags on our Sites, go to <a href="http://www.privacyrights.info/">www.privacyrights.info</a>. You may also obtain more information about targeted or “interest-based advertising” by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (Digital Advertising Alliance(US)) or <a href="http://www.youradchoices.ca/choices/">www.youradchoices.ca/choices/</a> (Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada). Opting out of participating ad networks does not opt you out of being served advertising. You may continue to receive generic or “contextual” ads on our Services. You may also continue to receive targeted ads on other websites, from companies that do not participate in the above programs.</p>
<h2 id="par-7">7. SECURITY </h2>
<p>We have implemented a variety of safeguards designed to protect personal information we collect from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>
<h2 id="par-8">8. THIRD PARTY AND CO-BRANDED SITES AND OTHER SERVICES </h2>
<p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites, mobile applications or other services, operated by a third party and subject to a different privacy policy. You should review the privacy policy on any website, mobile application or online service. Please be aware that FCA US is not responsible for and cannot control the privacy practices of other websites or third parties. Our Services may also contain links to co-branded websites that may display the FCA US logo and trademarks but are maintained by third parties, and do not display this Privacy Policy. Please read the privacy policies provided on these co-branded websites, which govern the privacy practices relating to personal information collected via that website.</p>
<h2 id="par-9">9. RIGHTS AND CHOICES </h2>
<p>In this section we describe the choices individuals have regarding our collection, use and handling of their personal information. If you are a California resident, see the Additional Information for California Residents section below for information about your rights under California privacy laws.</p>
