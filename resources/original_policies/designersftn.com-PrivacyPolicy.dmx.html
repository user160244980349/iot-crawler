<h5>Information Not Requiring Consent</h5>
We may share anonymized information and statistics in aggregate form with third parties for business purposes, for example with advertisers on our website, or we may tell our business partners the number of customers in certain demographic groups who purchased certain products or who carried out certain transactions.<br>
<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that we are permitted by law to collect, use or disclose your personal data without your consent, such permission granted by the law shall continue to apply.<br>
&nbsp;
<h5>Information Safety Safeguards</h5>
We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. We have put in place the following security procedures and technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal data:<br>
<br>
Your personal data is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities.<br>
<br>
All data saved in the back-end is classified into different levels based on the importance and sensitivity of the data, e.g. whether the data contains personal data.<br>
<br>
In the data centers, clusters that contain sensitive data are grouped together in the network topology, and will be placed in rooms with additional physical security protection.<br>
<br>
Data exchanged between DF devices and servers are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL").<br>
<br>
There is an optional two-step verification process when users access their DF Account.<br>
<br>
There is regular review of information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.<br>
<br>
Access is restricted to DF employees and Third Party Service Providers who need to know that the information in order to process it, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet such obligations.<br>
<br>
There are also access controls for all server clusters used for cloud-based data storage and process.<br>
<br>
Most data used for DF's products and/or services is stored in a storage system. By using column family based access control mechanism, DF employees are only allowed access to the data column families they are granted access to.<br>
<br>
Please note also that for the above, DF may use overseas facilities operated and controlled by DF to process or back up your personal data. Currently, DF has data centers in Beijing and Singapore. As a result, we may transfer to and store your personal data at our overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
Information safety is very important to us. We will take all practicable steps to safeguard your personal data. Through our protective measures above, especially encrypted storage and transmission, your data is as secure as it can be. Certain details of encrypted data cannot be accessed by anyone except by you.<br>
&nbsp;
<h5>When this Privacy Policy applies</h5>
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products and services offered by a third party. DF products and services may include third party's products or services. When you use such products or services, they may collect your information too. For this reason, we strongly suggest you to read the third party's privacy policy as you have taken time to read ours. We are not responsible for and cannot control how third parties use personal data which they collect from you. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other sites linked from our services.<br>
&nbsp;
<h5>Minors</h5>
We consider it the responsibility of parents to monitor their children's use of our products and services. Nevertheless, it is our policy not to require personal data from minors or offer to send any promotional materials to persons in that category. DF does not seek or intend to seek to receive any personal data from minors. Should a parent or guardian have reasons to believe that a minor has provided DF with personal data without their prior consent, please contact us to ensure that the personal data is removed and unsubscribe them from any of the applicable DF services.<br>
&nbsp;
<h5>Updates To The Privacy Policy</h5>
We keep our Privacy Policy under regular review. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the changes on all the DF websites, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it. Such changes to our Privacy Policy shall apply from the time that we post the same on the DF websites. Your continued use of products and services on the websites, mobile phones and/or any other device will be taken as acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy. We will seek your fresh consent before we collect more personal data from you or when we wish to use or disclose your personal data for new purposes.<br>
