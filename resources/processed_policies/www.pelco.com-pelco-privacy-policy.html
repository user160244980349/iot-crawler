    <h3>
        Why we collect your personal information?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide our customers and other users with superior service and a smooth, efficient and personalized experience while using our site or services. For example, if you purchase products or request information on the sites, we use your personal information to fill your order or provide the requested information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pelco may collect personal Information from you to complete various transactions, such as:
    </p>
    <li>
        product or service orders, activations and registrations
    </li>
    <li>
        profile creation
    </li>
    <li>
        information requests
    </li>
    <li>
        marketing or support subscriptions
    </li>
    <li>
        contest entries or survey participation
    </li>
    <li>
        notifications of firmware updates
    </li>
    <h3>
        What information is collected?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Pelco collects and uses your personal information to better serve you and personalize your experience and interaction. Such collection is done with appropriate notice and consent, along with required filings with data protection authorities, where applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal information (or personal data) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        This privacy statement does not cover personal information rendered anonymous or where pseudonyms are used. Data is rendered anonymous if individual persons are no longer identifiable or are identifiable only with a disproportionately large expense in time, cost, or labour. The use of pseudonyms involves the replacement of names or other identifiers with substitutes, so that identification of individual persons is either impossible or at least rendered considerably more difficult. If data rendered anonymous becomes no longer anonymous (i.e., individual persons are again identifiable), or if pseudonyms are used and the pseudonyms allow identification of individual persons, then this privacy statement will again apply.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is always up to you whether to disclose personal information to us, although if you elect not to do so, we reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services.
    </p>
    <p>
        The types of personal information we collect from you may include:
    </p>
    <li>
        your name, company, email address, phone number, billing address and shipping address
    </li>
    <li>
        customer type, job function, job title, purchasing authority, purchasing timeframe and others
    </li>
    <li>
        product and service preferences, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data
    </li>
    <li>

    </p>
    <p>
        Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:
    </p>
    <p>

        <br/>
        Deletion Request Rights
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
    </p>
    <li>
        Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
    </li>
    <li>
        Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>

    </li>

    <li>
        Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
        <br/>
        Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
    </li>
    <p>
        To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by email at privacy@pelco.com with the subject line: CCPA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
    </p>
    <li>
        Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
    </li>
    <p>
        We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Response Timing and Format
    </h3>
    <p>
        We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to the registered email associated with the account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Non-Discrimination
    </h3>
    <p>
        We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
