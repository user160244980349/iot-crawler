<h4 style="color: #333;"><em>Last Updated on July 14, 2020 Version 07142020</em></h4>
<h4 style="color: #333;">PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
<p>Horizon Marketing Group, LLC and its affiliates, parent companies, and subsidiaries (collectively, “we”, “us”, “our”) provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that you provide to us or that we collect from you through our websites (<a href="https://homezonesecurity.com/">https://homezonesecurity.com/</a>) and its related webpages sharing the same core domain; our social media pages that we control; and the services offered through the Site and app, and other online or mobile services, applications or advertisements that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively hereinafter, our “Properties”).</p>
<p>The Properties may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under the control of or maintained by us.

<h4>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT/HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</h4>
<p><u>Personal Information</u></p>

In addition, if you elect to connect your social media account to your website account, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include personal information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles.</p>
<p>This personal information can include data attributes like your full name, username, password, email address, telephone number, physical or mail addresses, work/company information, date of birth and other information you may provide to us, in some limited cases, national ID numbers, like your social security number, for tax reporting purposes related to some high-value promotional prize awards. It may also include other personally identifiable information we have collected from you, such as your attitudes and opinions about and usage of our products, demographics, interests, household, health or lifestyle information, satisfaction with our website and newsletters, your purchasing behavior or history and your browsing, downloading and other internet activity. If you have contacted us on behalf of a business or other entity, we may also collect your work contact information and details about your business or entity that you provide. We may also collect information that is publicly available or provided by third parties and collect information that you provide us about others. For example, we may collect certain information that is posted on social media sites, blogs and other websites. We may also purchase or obtain e-mail lists, customer leads and other data sources from third parties for our advertising and marketing purposes.</p>
<p>In some instances, we may combine your personal information with other information about you, such as combining your name with your geographic location or your browsing or purchasing history. We also may combine personal information with information we receive about you from outside sources. For example, we may obtain commercially available demographic or profile information about you from third parties, receive device information from mobile applications or advertisements or match your profile with information about you provided by retailers or data brokers.</p>
<p>If you disclose any personal information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with our Properties, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. You agree to indemnify us for any claims resulting from your breach of this foregoing representation and warranty.</p>
<p><u>Returns information</u></p>
<p>When you return a product to us or request a refund or exchange, we may collect information from you and ask you to provide your government issued ID. We use the information we collect from you and capture off of your government issued ID to help prevent fraud.</p>
<p><u>Demographic information</u></p>
<p>We may collect information not limited to about products or services you like, reviews you submit, or where you shop. We might also collect information like your age or gender.</p>
<p><u>Location information</u></p>
<p>If you use our websites, we may collect location data obtained from your IP address. We may use this location data to find our nearest store to you, product availability at warehouse near you and driving directions to our warehouse. Some of our Properties may allow you to submit information about your general location, such as your zip code or address, in order to locate stores that sell our products or provide other services. Some of our Properties also may capture and record certain precise geo-location or global positioning data from your device in order to provide location-related functionality. We may link such location data to other information that you provide to us or that may be accessed in connection with your use of our Properties. If we combine any location information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information as long as it is combined.</p>
<p><u>Device information&nbsp;</u><u>we collect through our Properties and third party providers</u></p>
<p><strong><em>Server log files</em></strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit one of our Properties, along with the time of the visit, the page(s) that were visited and other information related to your visit.&nbsp; We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering our Properties. For example, if you accessed one of our Properties using a mobile device like a smartphone, we may also collect your phone’s unique device ID and other similar mobile device data.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cookies and similar technologies</em></strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; A “Cookie” is a small text file containing a random and unique alphanumeric identifier that our Properties may transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser that enables our systems to recognize your browser. We may employ technologies like Cookies, web beacons, clear GIF, pixel or Internet tag technologies to uniquely identify your account, or the IP address associated with your Internet device. We also permit third parties and our service providers to gather information on our websites, including for advertising purposes, through these technologies, as described&nbsp;<a href="https://www.burtsbees.com/content/privacy-and-security/privacy-policy.html#InterestAds">below</a>. Cookies and the other technologies mentioned above provide information related to the ways consumers interact with our advertising or our Properties, like browser type, browsing behaviors, user web requests, pages and content viewed, the number of new visits or log-ins, search engine referral, affiliate referrals, traffic driven by banner ads or other promotions, which items are placed in shopping carts and which are abandoned, conversions and what purchases were made and zip codes. These technologies can contain or store personal and other information (such as if you have previously registered on our Properties or consented to the retention of certain personal information) and allow web browser servers to recognize return visits to our Properties and improve web browsing navigation or the quality and delivery of certain features or customized content through our Properties. Some Cookies (known as “persistent cookies”) will remain on your computer or Internet device until you delete them, while others (known as “session cookies”) are automatically erased when you exit your Internet browser. You can set your computer or Internet device to accept or reject most Cookies, or to notify you in most situations that a Cookie is offered so that you can decide whether to accept it. However, if you block Cookies, certain features on our Properties may not function. Additionally, even if you block or delete Cookies, not all tracking will necessarily stop.</p>
<p><em>Flash LSOs</em>:&nbsp; We and our third-party service providers may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) in certain situations, including to recognize you and remember your preferences or other details about your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you generally cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs from your browser.</p>

<p><u>Analytical and statistical information&nbsp;</u><u>we collect through our Properties</u></p>
<p><strong><em>De-identified information</em></strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; We may conduct surveys and otherwise collect information that does not uniquely identify any individual. This might include demographic information like age and income range, gender, education, household size and marital status, as well as information from which identifying particulars have been removed. We also may aggregate personal information in a manner that no longer reveals your identity. We may collect, use and disclose such information for any purpose, such as research to improve our products or advertising.</p>
<p><strong><em>Website analytics</em></strong><strong>:</strong> We may work with third-party service providers who may use technologies described in this Privacy Statement above to conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Properties. For example, we use the third party providers as described above.</p>
<p><u>Other information</u></p>
<p>If you use our Properties, we may collect information about the browser you are using. We might track the pages you visit, look at what website you came from, or what website you visit when you leave us. We collect this information using the tracking tools described here to control those tools.</p>
<h4>OUR TRACKING TECHNIQUES</h4>
<p><u>Tracking Tools We Use</u></p>
<p>We may collect personal and other information about users over time and across different websites when you use our Properties. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way through the methods described above. We or our vendors use several common online tracking tools to collect this information. These may include browser and flash cookies. We may also use web beacons and similar technologies. We use these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>To track new visitors to our websites.</li>
<li>To recognize returning customers.</li>
<li>To provide you with advertising content in which we think you will be interested. As part of this customization, we may observe your behaviors on this website or on other websites. We may also get information about your browsing history from our trusted business partners and vendors.</li>
<li>So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors, and their respective interests.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Controlling Our Tracking Tools Via Your Browser</u></p>
<p>Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies.</p>
<p>If you configure your computer to block cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Properties. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop. Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These browser features are not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.</p>
