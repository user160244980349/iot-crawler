        6.1 Right to withdraw the data protection declaration of consent (Article 7 para. 3 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
        In case that the processing of your data by us is based on your explicit consent you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until withdrawal. You will be informed about this right before you give your consent.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6.2 Right to information (Article 15 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
        In accordance with Article 15 GDPR, you have the right to request confirmation from us as to whether we process personal data concerning you. If this is the case, you have a right to information about these personal data and to the following information:
        <em>
            [list the information according to Article 15 GDPR]
        </em>
        . When personal data is transferred to a third country or an international organization you have the right to be informed about appropriate safeguards to ensure that the recipients are also in compliance with the provisions of the GDPR.

    <h3>
        6.3 Right to correction (Article 16 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
        You can request us to correct any incorrect data concerning you without delay. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you also have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data - also by means of a supplementary declaration.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6.4 Right to deletion or "right to be forgotten" (Article 17 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
        You have the right to request the immediate deletion of your data if one of the following reasons applies:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed,
        </li>
        <li>
            you withdraw your consent on which the processing was based and there is no other legal basis for the processing,
        </li>
        <li>
            you oppose to the processing pursuant to Article 21 para. 1 GDPR for reasons arising from your particular situation and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for processing,
        </li>
        <li>
            you oppose to the processing for direct marketing in accordance with Article 21 para. 2 GDPR,
        </li>
        <li>
            the data have been processed unlawfully,
        </li>
        <li>
            the deletion of data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation under European or German law,
        </li>
        <li>
            the data were collected in relation to an offer of information society services directly to a child provided in accordance with Article 8 para. 1 GDPR.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We will comply with the request for deletion unless we are legally obliged or entitled to continue storing and processing your data. In particular legal retention periods are considered as legal obligations. Furthermore we are entitled to continued storage if we are unable to assert, exercise or defend legal claims without your data.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we have made your data public and are obliged to delete it, we will take appropriate measures, taking into account the available technology and the implementation costs, to inform those responsible if you have also requested the deletion from them.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6.5 Right to limitation of processing (Article 18 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
        In accordance with Article 18 GDPR, we may only process data to a limited extent in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            you dispute the accuracy of your data until we are able to verify its accuracy,
        </li>
        <li>
            the processing is unlawful and you refuse to delete your data and instead request that the use of personal data be restricted,
        </li>
        <li>
            we no longer need the data for the purposes of processing, but you do need them to assert, exercise or defend legal claims, or
        </li>
        <li>
            you object to the processing pursuant to Article 21 para. 1 GDPR for reasons arising from your particular situation, as long as it is not yet clear whether the legitimate reasons for the processing by us outweigh your interests.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If processing has been restricted we may only store this data. Any further processing in such case is only permissible with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or on grounds of an important public interest of the Union or a Member State. You can revoke your consent given in this connection at any time. You will be notified by us before the restriction is lifted.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6.6 Notification Obligation regarding Rectification or Erasure of Personal Data (Article 19 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
        We are obliged to inform all recipients to whom your data have been disclosed about a correction or deletion of your data or a restriction of the processing. This shall not apply if it is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. We will inform you about these recipients if so requested.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6.7 Right to data transferability (Article 20 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
        You have the right to receive the data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, common and machine-readable format. You also have the right to instruct us with the transmission of your data to a third party, provided that
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            the processing of the data is based on your consent or on a contract and
        </li>
        <li>
            processing is carried out using automated methods.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may request that we transfer your data directly to the third party if this is technically feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this right must not impair the rights and freedoms of other persons, including our company. If this is the case, we are entitled to refuse the delivery or transfer of your data.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6.8 Automated Decision in Individual Cases including Profiling (Article 22 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
        On our websites your data is not subject of decisions made exclusively on the basis of automated processing (e.g. profiling). You have the right not to be subject to a decision based exclusively on automated processing - including profiling - if this has legal effect against you or significantly impairs it in a similar manner.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6.9 Right to Object (Article 21 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
        If we process your data on the basis of a legitimate interest (Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR), you have the right to object to this if the reasons for this arise from your particular situation. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this case, we will no longer process your data unless we can prove compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing. This must outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we process your data for direct marketing purposes, you may object to the processing of your data. This also applies to profiling insofar as it is connected with such direct advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
        After your objection your data will no longer be processed for these purposes.
    </p>
    <h3>
        6.10 Right of Appeal to a Supervisory Authority (Article 77 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <p>
        You have the right to complain to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State where you are staying, working or suspect that an infringement of the General Data Protection Regulation against you has taken place. Other administrative or judicial remedies that you may be entitled to remain unaffected.
