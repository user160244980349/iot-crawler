We maintain one or more databases to store your Personal Information and may retain it as reasonably required to serve you and operate the Service. Personal Information that we collect depends on how you use the Service. Providing your Personal Information to us is your choice. If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, you may not be able to take advantage of certain features of the Service; and</li> <li>Information We Collect Automatically: When you visit the Service, we may automatically collect identifier and other technical information, such as your browser information, operating system information, device information, TCP-IP address and the date, time, length of stay and specific pages accessed during your visits to the Service (“Online Information”).</li> </ul> <p>Registering for the Service</p> <p>If you register to use the Service, we may collect Personal Information including your name, email address, and telephone number.</p> <p>You may also register for the Service using another service, such as Facebook. If you create your Patient Aid LLC account by connecting through another service, you are authorizing us to use public information from that connected account to help complete your Patient Aid LLC profile. Please remember that the manner in which the service uses, stores, and discloses your information is governed solely by the policies of such service. We recommend that you review the terms and policies of that service, including its privacy and data gathering practices. Patient Aid LLC shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any third party service provider or any other third-party site or service that may be enabled within the Service.</p> <p>You may review, update, or modify your account information, including profile and contact information, at any time by logging into your Patient Aid LLC account. You may also permanently delete your account by contacting us here.</p> <p>Online Identification Tools</p> <p>Like many website providers, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and provide a better web experience. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and gather Online Information.</p> <p>We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and for other purposes like personalizing the Service. A cookie is a small file stored by your internet browser on your computer. A "session cookie" stores temporary information that is erased when you close your web browser or turn off your computer. A "persistent cookie" enables the Service to recognize you when you return to it and remains stored on your computer until you delete it. Your web browser is usually set up to initially accept cookies. If you set your browser to reject cookies, the Service will not be able to recognize your account or to personalize the content that you see. A "flash cookie," also known as a "local storage object," is not stored in your browser, unlike other cookies, and instead placed on your computer by websites that use Adobe Flash. You may disable flash cookies via your Flash Player preferences or by using third-party software. We do not and cannot use cookies to gather other information that may be stored on your hard drive.</p> <p>Third-party advertising management partners may help us display tailored content to our customers’ interests and serve interest-based advertising on our behalf. Patient Aid LLC and our advertising management partners may use cookies, web beacons and other tools to collect Online Information about your activities on the Service, to deliver advertising on the Service or elsewhere on the Internet based upon your interests that may be more relevant to you and to measure effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the Service. In particular, Patient Aid LLC may use Google Analytics to monitor activity on the Site and assist with advertising. To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.</p> <p>Opting out of receiving interest-based advertisements does not mean you will no longer see digital advertisements from Patient Aid LLC or our ad management partners; rather, opting out means that most of the digital advertisements that you do see will not be based on your particular interests. In addition, certain data collection tools on the Service (including cookies) still may collect information about your use of the Service, such as for analytics and fraud prevention.</p> <p>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</p> <p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many digital service operators, including PatientAid, do not recognize or respond to DNT signals.</p>    </body></html>
