        <strong>
            6.1 General information
        </strong>
        <br/>
        You can subscribe to our newsletter offering information on our current deals and promotions by granting your consent pursuant to Article 6 para. 1a GDPR. The subscription to our newsletter uses the so-called double opt-out procedure. After you have registered on our website, we will send an email to the address specified by you. The email will ask you to confirm your subscription to our newsletter. Your data will be blocked and automatically deleted after 1 month if your subscription is not confirmed within 72 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        The IP addresses, as well as the time and date of your subscription and confirmation will be stored for longer periods. This serves the purpose of being able to evidence your subscription and investigate any potential misuse of your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your email address, language and country are the only mandatory information required for receiving our newsletter. The disclosure of other data marked as optional is voluntary and will only be used for personalized communication with you. After you have confirmed your subscription, your email address will be stored by us for the purpose of sending you our newsletter. The legal basis for this collection of data is Article 6 para. 1a GDPR:
    </p>
    <p>
        You may revoke your consent to receive the newsletter and cancel your subscription at any time. You can declare your revocation of consent by clicking on the link included in each newsletter email, or by contacting the Data Protection Officer at the address specified above.

        </strong>
        <br/>
        Please note that we analyse your user behaviour when sending out the newsletter. The data for this analysis is gathered by so-called tracking pixels, which are embedded in the emails. The data is analysed by linking the data specified above and the tracking pixels with your email address and an individual ID. This ID is also part of the links contained in the newsletter.
    </p>
    <p>
        All data is collected in pseudonymised format only. This means that the IDs are not linked to any other personal data, which effectively precludes any direct references to persons. We will store the data for as long as you remain subscribed to the newsletter.
    </p>
    <p>
        This kind of tracking can be prevented by disabling the automatic display of images in your email program settings. This may cause the newsletter to be displayed incompletely and you may not be able to use all functions. The tracking mentioned above will be activated when you click on "show image".

    <p>
        These plugins will usually collect your data automatically and transmit the data to the respective operator's server. To guarantee your privacy is protected, we have taken technical measures that guarantee your data cannot be collected by the provider of the respective plug-in without your consent. When accessing a site with embedded plug-ins, these are initially deactivated. The plus-ins are only activated by clicking the relevant symbol, and in doing so you grant your consent to the transmission of your data to the respective operator. The legal basis for the use of plug-ins is Article 6 para. 1a and f GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following activation, the plug-ins also collect personal data such as your IP address, and transmit these to the server of the respective provider, where they will be stored. Activated social plug-ins also create a cookie with a unique identifier when the website in question is accessed. Providers are thus also able to create profiles about your usage behaviour. This also happens if you are not a member of the social network of the respective provider. If you are a member of the provider's social network and you are logged in to the social network while you visit this website, your data and information about visiting this website can be combined with your profile on the social network. We have no influence on the exact scope of the data collected about you by the respective provider. More detailed information on the scope, nature and purpose of data processing and on rights and settings options to protect your privacy can be found on the data protection notices of the respective social network provider.

        We use the services explained in the following to analyse and optimize our webpages. These services allow us to analyse how users navigate our website, which information they are looking for and how users came across our service. The data collected by us includes information about the website that has referred the user to one of our webpages (the so called referrer), the sub-pages the user has accessed or how frequently and for how long a sub-page was viewed. This helps us in improving our services and in making them more user-friendly. The data collected is not used to identify individual users. It is anonymised or at least pseudonymised. The legal basis for this collection of data is Article 6 para. 1f GDPR:

        This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service offered by Google Inc, (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). We use Googly Analytics in the universal analytics mode. This allows for the allocation of data, sessions and interactions to a pseudonymous user ID across multiple devices and therefore an analysis of the user's activities across multiple devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Google Analytics uses cookies to analyse your use of our website. The information about your use of the website generated by the cookie is generally transferred to a Google server in the USA, where it is saved. If IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will be truncated by Google within Member States of the European Union or in other States party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The full IP address will only be transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there in exceptional cases. The IP address sent by your browser for the purposes of Google Analytics will not be merged with other data. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your usage of the website, to compile reports on the website activities, and to provide the website operator with additional services related to website and internet use. These purposes establish our legitimate interest in processing the data. The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is Article 6 para. 1f GDPR. The data that is sent by us and linked with cookies, user names (e.g. user ID) or advertising IDs will be deleted automatically after 14 months. Data that has reached the maximum retention period is deleted automatically on a monthly basis. You can find more information on the terms of use and data protection at
