<div class="su-tabs-pane su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" data-title="Payment &amp; Shipping"><p></p>
<h3>How to Place an Order</h3>
<p>Orders can only be placed online at www.samotech.co.uk. When you place an order, we will send you an order acknowledgement by email containing all the details of your order. This is not an order confirmation but an acknowledgement that your order has been received. Our acceptance of your order will take place when we send you a completed order confirmation email. Any products on the same order, which we have not confirmed in a Completed Order Confirmation email, will not form part of that contract.We reserve the right to refuse an order. Non acceptance of an order may be as a result of one of the following, but not limited to: the product ordered being out of stock; our inability to obtain the authorisation for payment; the identification of an error within the product information, including price and promotional offers; you not meeting the eligibility to order as set out in the Terms and Conditions. You are seeking to enter into a contract with Samotech Plus Limited when you place an order.</p>
<h3>Method of Payment</h3>
<p>We accept payment using all major credit/debit cards and PayPal.</p>
<h3>Security/Privacy</h3>
<p>We take security and your privacy very seriously, no credit card details are kept on this server. All the payments are processed through PayPal/Stripe secured servers. Your personal details from your order are only used to process your order and to occasionally inform you about any relevant information.</p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>Royal Mail is our preferable shipping courier. We endeavour to dispatch your order within one working day of receipt. We shall notify you whenever this is not possible. When you choose Standard Shipping into Europe, transit times will be longer depending on the destination. Please note that we can not accept the responsibility for any failure on the part of the courier or delivery service used to deliver goods. For your peace of mind it is strongly suggested to choose the International Tracked and Signed shipping when ordering from Europe. As a rule of thumb major European destinations will take approximately 3-5 working days. Please do bear in mind that none of these transit times are guaranteed, and while we are very happy with the reliability of Royal Mail services, things can get delayed, although this is rare.</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" data-title="Returns &amp; Cancellation Policy"><p></p>
<h3>Returns &amp; Refunds</h3>
<p>You have 30 days to return your unwanted order back to us. In the event you would like to proceed with a return, please contact us first. Goods must be returned in as new and unused condition in the original packaging. Buyer is responsible for all the return postage costs and an adequate packaging. Once we have received your items we will then issue you with a full refund back on to your original payment method as soon as possible. Returns can only be processed with a proof of purchase. This can be the sales receipt or an online sales invoice along with the order number. We do not cover products faults caused by accident, neglect, misuse or normal wear and tear.</p>
<h3>Replacement</h3>
<p>We do not offer an exchange service. If you would like an alternative product, please return the unwanted/incorrect product(s) and place a new order for the product(s) which you would like. We will refund you for the returned product(s) as per our Returns &amp; Refunds procedure.</p>
