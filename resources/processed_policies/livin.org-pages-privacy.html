        COLLECTION
    </h2>
    <h3>
        TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED
    </h3>
    <p>
        We may collect and hold personal information about you, that is, information that can identify you, and is relevant to providing you with the services you are seeking. This can include your name, date of birth, contact details (including address, email address, phone number), financial information (such as credit card or bank account numbers) and information about how you use our products and services.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not an exhaustive list. We may need to collect additional information about you from time to time to provide products or services to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You might also need to provide us with personal information about other individuals (e.g. your authorised representatives). If so, we rely on you to inform those individuals that you are providing their personal information to us and to advise them about this policy.
    </p>
    <h3>
        PURPOSE OF COLLECTION
    </h3>
    <p>
        The type of personal information that we collect and hold about you depends on your interaction with us. Generally, we will collect, use and hold your personal information for the purposes of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            providing products or services to you or someone else you know;
        </li>
        <li>
            issuing tax invoices for the products or services we may provide to you from time to time;
        </li>
        <li>
            providing you with information about other services that we, our related entities and other organisations that we have affiliations with, offer that may be of interest to you;
        </li>
        <li>
            facilitating our internal business operations, including the fulfilment of any legal requirements; and
        </li>
        <li>
            analysing our services and customer needs with a view to developing new or improved services.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        METHOD OF COLLECTION
    </h3>
    <p>
        Personal information will generally be collected directly from you either by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            providing us with ‘your story’ relating to mental health which could be showcased on the Livin website or in the Livin newsletter;
        </li>
        <li>
            you paying fees owed by you to us or our clients using third party payment systems or other electronic payment platforms we may utilise from time to time; or
        </li>
        <li>
            through the use of any of our standard forms (such as when you enter into an agreement with us, contact us with a query or request or submit your details through our website or by email).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We may also collect information other than directly from you where it is unreasonable or impractical to not do so, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            from third parties such as our related entities, business partners, or your representatives;
        </li>
        <li>
            from publicly available sources of information;
        </li>
        <li>
            from our records of how you use our services; and
        </li>
        <li>
            from the third parties we list in the section of this policy with the heading ‘Use and disclosure’.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We will usually notify you in advance when we indirectly collect information, or where that is not possible, as soon as reasonably practicable after the information has been collected.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose not to provide certain information about you, we may not be able to provide you with the products or services you require, or the level of service on which we pride ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the personal information you provide to us is incomplete or inaccurate, we may be unable to provide you, or someone else you know, with the products or services you, or they, are seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our website and credit card security transactions are the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) ensuring your privacy and security which encrypts your information as it is transmitted over the internet. The encryption scrambles details such as your credit card number, billing details and delivery address so that generally, other computers are unable to decipher the information ensuring privacy and security.

            third party product or service providers, who assist us in operating our business (including for the purposes of collecting payment and assisting us in providing you with the products and/or services that you have requested or have expressed an interest), and these service providers may not be required to comply with our privacy policy;

    </p>
    <p>
        We are not likely to disclose your personal information to overseas recipients. However, in the course of providing our goods and services it may become necessary or desirable to disclose personal information to overseas recipients. The countries in which these overseas recipients may be located will depend on the individual circumstances of the relevant matter and it is not practicable to specify them in this Privacy Policy.

    <h3>
        INTERNATIONAL USERS
    </h3>
    <p>
        In some circumstances, we may collect personal information from you which may be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            subject to local, regional or international privacy or data protection laws in jurisdictions other than Australia (‘
            <strong>
                International Law
            </strong>
            ’); and/or
        </li>
        <li>
            deemed by International Law specifically in relation to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (‘
            <strong>
                Data Protection Law

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Data Protection Law recognises that some categories of personal information are more sensitive. Sensitive information can include information about a person’s health, race, ethnic origin, political opinions criminal history, financial position, sex life, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. If you contact us, you may choose to provide details of a sensitive nature. We will only use this information in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For the purposes of dealing with your enquiry;
        </li>
        <li>
            We will not pass on your details to anyone else without your express permission except in exceptional circumstances. Examples of this might include anyone reporting serious self-harm or posing a threat to others or children contacting us and sharing serious issues such as physical abuse or exploitation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Where you have given us your express consent or otherwise clearly indicated to us that you are happy for us to share your story, then we may publish it on our website or in other media.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the instances where International Law requires more restrictive information handling practices than the practices set out in this Privacy Policy specifically in relation to Data Protection Law we will ensure that we have appropriate controls in place to secure your information by adjusting our information handling practices in your jurisdiction to comply with International Law.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the extent permitted or required under International Law, you consent to us using and disclosing your personal information (including in jurisdictions where it is deemed sensitive information) for the purpose for which it was collected, unless you subsequently consent to us using and disclosing your information for another purpose as described in further detail above
    </p>
    <p>

We will, in all circumstances, safeguard the personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
