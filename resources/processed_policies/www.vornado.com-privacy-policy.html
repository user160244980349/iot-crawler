        The Website may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button and the Twitter “Follow” button), which let you share actions you take on the Website with other media. The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the privacy settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. You use these social sharing features at your own risk. No security measures, including the privacy settings referenced above, are perfect or impenetrable.

    <p>
        The Company uses commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of your information with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. Likewise, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers and make sure you use a secure browser. The Website uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where Personal Information is required. We may update browser requirements from time to time by posting a notice on the Website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of the global nature of the Internet, when you give us information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Except as discussed above or otherwise designated, the Website does not use security encryption measures. Therefore, information that you disclose by use of the Website (as with any website that is non-secure), by posting a message or using e-mail, potentially could be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties or use of such information by third parties for their own purposes, legal or illegal. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our services, and you do so at your own risk.

Once you have used these links to leave the Website, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information and Personal Information. Before visiting and providing any information to any third party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information and Personal Information.

    <p>
        The California Consumer Privacy Act requires businesses to disclose whether they sell Personal Information. As a business, we do not sell Personal Information. We may share Personal Information with third parties or allow them to collect Personal Information from our Website or services if those third parties are authorized service providers or business partners who have agreed to our contractual limitations as to their retention, use, and disclosure of such Personal Information, or if you use our Website or services to interact with third parties or direct us to disclose your Personal Information to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        California law requires that we detail the categories of Personal Information that we share or disclose for certain “business purposes,” such as disclosures to service providers that assist us with securing our services or marketing our products. We disclose the following categories of Personal Information for our business purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Identifiers;

        California law grants state residents certain rights, including the rights to access specific types of Personal Information, to learn how we process Personal Information, to request deletion of Personal Information, and not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and have registered for an account with us, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to our Website. Please note that your request may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, because, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.
