            d. How to Exercise Your Rights
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Watts will respond to requests in accordance with applicable law if it can verify the identity of the individual submitting the request. California Consumers and Canadian Residents can exercise their rights in the following ways:
    </p>
    <p>
        i. Complete the online request form available at
        <a href="http://www.watts.com/support/ccpa">
            www.watts.com/support/ccpa
        </a>
        , or
    </p>
    <p>
        ii. Contact us by email, telephone or mail using the contact information listed below.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            e. Requests by Authorized Agents
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You may designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights. If an authorized agent submits a request on your behalf, the authorized agent must submit with the request either (a) a power of attorney that is valid under California or Canadian law, or (b) a document signed by you that authorizes the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf. In addition, we may ask you to follow the applicable process described below for verifying your identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            f. How We Will Verify Your Requests
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        i. The processes that we follow to verify that the person making a request is the person about whom we have collected Personal Information are described below. The relevant process depends on how and why the request is submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Requests Through Your Password-Protected Account: If you created a password-protected account with us before the date of your request, we will rely on the fact that your request has been submitted through your account as verification of your identity. We will require that you re-authenticate yourself before we carry out your request.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are responsible for protecting the security of your log-in credentials for your account. Please do not share your log-in credentials with anyone. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity on or from your account, we will not respond to a request until we have been able to confirm, through further verification procedures, that you made the request.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Requests Other Than Through A Password-Protected Account: If you submit a request by any means other than through a password-protected account that you created before the date of your request, the verification process that we follow will depend on the nature of your request as described below:
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Requests To Know Categories Of Personal Information: We will match at least two data points that you provide with your request to know, or in response to our request for verification information, against information about you we already have in our records and that we have determined to be reliable for purposes of verifying your identity. Examples of relevant data points include your mobile phone number, your zip code, or information about products or services that you have purchased from us.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Requests To Know Specific Pieces Of Personal Information: We will match at least three data points that you provide with your request to know, or in response to our request for verification information, against information that we already have about you in our records and that we have determined to be reliable for purposes of verifying your identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. Requests To Delete Personal Information: Our process for verifying your identity will depend on the sensitivity (as determined by Watts) of the Personal Information that you ask us to delete. For less sensitive Personal Information, we will require a match of two data points. For more sensitive Personal Information, we will require a match of three data points.
    </p>
    <p>
        ii. We have implemented the following additional procedures when verifying the identity of requestors:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. If we cannot verify your identity based on the processes described above, we may ask you for additional verification information. If we do so, we will permanently delete the verification information that you provide promptly after we have completed the verification process. We will not use that information for any purpose other than verification.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty to respond to your request, we will let you know promptly and explain why we cannot verify your identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            g. Watts’ Non-Discrimination Policy
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        California Consumers and Canadian residents have the right not to be subject to discriminatory treatment by Watts for exercising their privacy rights under the CCPA, and Watts will not discriminate on that basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            h. Your Right to Information About Disclosures of Personal Information for Direct Marketing Purposes
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        California Consumers and Canadian Residents can request information from us whether we have disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. We will not sell your Personal Information to, or share it with, third-party companies for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. California Consumers and Canadian Residents desiring to request further information about our compliance with these laws or who have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies are welcome to contact us using the contact information below.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            i. Your ‘Do Not Track’ Browser Setting
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Watts does not track you over time and across the Web to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. But we may use third party services, such as Google Ad Words, which do track you over time and across the Web to provide targeted advertising. Your browser can be set to DNT to stop such tracking.
    </p>
