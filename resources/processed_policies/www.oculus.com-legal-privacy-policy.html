                    We use information from Oculus Products to provide user-to-user communications and other social services across the Facebook Products, including identifying and connecting you with your friends (or people you have recently interacted with in an experience) through Oculus Products.

For example, for voice services, we analyse and review your voice commands using human and machine processes to improve, troubleshoot and train our speech recognition systems. When you enable the hand tracking feature, we collect technical information such as hand tracking quality, the amount of time it takes to detect your hands and the number of pinches you make to improve and troubleshoot this feature.

For example, we make available to third-party developers a list of your friends who also use the developer's app so that they can offer to pair you in a game or other experience within their app, or rank your scores and achievements in that app against your friends' scores and achievements. We also share information about individual abuse reports or abuse statistics on our Oculus Products so that we can help develop a safe and enjoyable XR ecosystem.
