        When you interact or communicate on social media channels/pages/promotions and blogs (e.g. when you click on ‘like’ or ‘share’, when you post and share comments and when you submit ratings and reviews) your Personal Data is processed by a third party that provides social listening services to Eaton.

            Cookies

    <p>
        Like many companies, Eaton uses “cookies” and other similar tracking technology (collectively "Cookies"). Eaton's server will query your browser to see if there are Cookies previously set by our electronic Information Channels.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            What are cookies?
            <br/>
        </strong>
        A cookie is a small text file which is placed on your device. Cookies help to analyze web traffic and allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. Certain cookies may contain Personal Data – for example, if you click “Remember me” when logging in, a cookie may store your username. Cookies may collect information, including a unique identifier, user preferences, profile information, membership information and general usage and volume statistical information. Cookies may also be used to collect individualized website use data, provide electronic Information Channel personalization or conduct and measure the effectiveness of advertising in accordance with this Notice.
        <br/>
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Eaton) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            What do we use cookies for?
            <br/>
        </strong>
        We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Information Channels to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Information Channels. Third parties serve cookies through our Information Channels for advertising, analytics and other purposes.
        <br/>
        We may place cookies or similar files on your device for security purposes, to tell us whether you have visited the Information Channels before, to remember your language preferences, to determine if you are new visitor or to otherwise facilitate site navigation, and to personalize your experience on our Information Channels. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Information Channels and pages visited. Cookies also allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them to you. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a website.
        <br/>
        The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Information Channels and the purposes they perform are described via the link below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Information Channel you visit).
        <br/>
        <strong>
            What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
            <br/>
        </strong>
        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphic files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our websites or opened an email we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their function.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            How can you manage your cookies?
            <br/>
        </strong>
        You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) to disable existing cookies; or (iii) to set your browser to automatically reject any cookies. However, please be aware that if you disable or reject cookies, some features and services may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Eaton Account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.

            Advertising technologies and networks

    Eaton uses third parties such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter and other programmatic advertising platforms to administer Eaton advertisements on third-party electronic channels. Personal data, such as user community or implied or inferred interests, may be used in the selection of advertising to make sure that it has relevance to the user. Some ads may contain embedded pixels that may write and read cookies or return session connection information that allows advertisers to better determine how many individual users have interacted with the ad.
    <br/>
    Eaton may also use advertising technologies and participate in advertising technology networks that collect usage information from Eaton and non-Eaton websites, as well as from other sources, to show you Eaton-related advertisements on Eaton’s own and third-party websites. These advertisements may be tailored to your perceived interests using retargeting and behavioral advertising technologies. Any retargeted or behavioral advertisements served to your browser will contain information on or near it that informs you about the advertising technology partner and how to opt-out of viewing such advertisements. Opting-out does not mean that you will stop receiving ads from Eaton. It means that you still stop receiving ads from Eaton that have been targeted to you based on your visits and browsing activity across websites over time.
    <br/>
    Cookie-based tools that allow you to opt-out of Interest-Based Advertising prevent Eaton and other participating advertising technology companies from serving interest-related ads to you on behalf of Eaton. They will only work on the internet browser on which they are deposited, and they will function only if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies. These cookie-based opt-out tools may not be as reliable where (e.g., certain mobile devices and operating systems) cookies are sometimes automatically disabled or removed. If you delete cookies, change browsers, computers or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again.   spacer

            Legal basis for processing Personal Data

    Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
    <br/>
    We will normally collect Personal Data from you only (i) where we have your consent to do so (ii) where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
    <br/>
    If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).   spacer

    At the end of the retention period or when we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, Eaton will delete or anonymize your Personal Data in a manner designed to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed or read.

    <p>
        Your Personal Data may be transferred to and processed in countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection and privacy laws that are different to the laws of your country.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of Personal Data between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect Personal Data they process from the European Economic Area (EEA) in accordance with European Union data protection law.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eaton adheres to the principles of EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks, although Eaton does not rely on the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield framework as legal basis for the transfer of Personal Data in light of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-311/18. Instead, Eaton uses different legal mechanisms to transfer Personal Data from Europe, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the US as described above.

    <p>
        Eaton Corporation and its US affiliates certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the transfer of Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. Although the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield have been ruled invalid for the transfer of data, where Personal Data has already been transferred to the U.S. on the basis of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, we will continue to protect Personal Data from the EU, Switzerland and the United Kingdom according to the standards of the Privacy Shield and applicable EU law.
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Eaton commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Eaton. You can find the contact information at the end of this section.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eaton has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU and Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under certain circumstances, you may invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eaton Corporation is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In that regard, it certifies that it complies with the seven EU-US Privacy Shield Framework Principles set forth by the United States Department of Commerce, in relation to Personal Data collected in the European Union.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eaton Corporation is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it received under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transferred to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Eaton Corporation complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

            <br/>

        Some third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. Eaton does not do this on Eaton websites. If you are visiting such sites, some browsers allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. Visit your browser settings to learn how to set these Do Not Track Signals.

        Third parties that have content embedded on Eaton’s websites, such as a social feature or a stock ticker, may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific Eaton website from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from Eaton’s websites unless you provide it to them directly.
