<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>2. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">We may use cookies, embedded scripts, software development kits (“SDKs”) and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect additional personal information automatically as you interact with the Services and to personalize your experience with our Services. We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites or other online services (“behavioral tracking”).</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><u>Cookies</u><br>
Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your device’s hard drive through your web browser that enables the site’s or provider’s system to recognize your browser and remember certain information. We use first-party and third-party cookies for the following purposes: to make our Services function properly, to improve our Site or services, to make login to our Site or services easier (such as by remembering your User ID), to recognize you when you return to our Site, to track your interaction with the Site or services, to enhance your experience with the Site or services, to remember information you have already provided, to collect information about your activities over time and across third party websites or other online services in order to deliver content and advertising tailored to your interests; and to provide a secure browsing experience during your use of our Site or services. The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device until they expire or are deleted (i.e. after you have finished browsing).</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">We may place cookies from third-party service providers who may use information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from us. We do not control the types of information collected and stored by these third-party cookies. You should check the third-party's website for more information on how they use cookies. The following types of cookies are used on our Site:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Strictly Necessary Cookies</em>. These cookies are essential because they enable you to use our Site. For example, strictly necessary cookies allow you to access secure areas on our Site. Without these cookies, some Services cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you for marketing purposes. This category of cookies is essential for our Site to work and they cannot be disabled.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Functional or Preference Cookies</em>. We use functional cookies to remember your choices so we can tailor our Site to provide you with enhanced features and personalized content. For example, these cookies can be used to remember your name or preferences on our Site. We do not use functional cookies to target you with online marketing. While these cookies can be disabled, this may result in less functionality during your use of our Site.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Performance or Analytic Cookies</em>. These cookies collect passive information about how you use our Site, including webpages you visit and links you click. We use the information collected by such cookies to improve and optimize our Site. We do not use these cookies to target you with online marketing. You can disable these cookies.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Advertising or Targeting Cookies</em>. These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. Our third-party advertising partners may use these cookies to build a profile of your interests and deliver relevant advertising on other sites. You may disable the use of these cookies as set forth below.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">We use Google Analytics on our web sites to collect usage data, to analyze how users use the web sites and to provide advertisements to you on other websites. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit </span><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">. For more information about how to opt out of having your information used by Google Analytics, visit </span><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><u>Behavioral Remarketing</u><br>
We also use remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites to you after you have visited our Site or used our Services. We and our third-party vendors use cookies to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to our Site. We use Google and other third parties these purposes. For more information on how to opt out of these ads, see “Your Choices” below.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><u>Other Tracking Technologies</u><br>
We may also use tracking technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, your device type, IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Site, webpages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the device or other credentials you use to access the Site for the same purposes.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Pages of our Site and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Pages of our Site may also use JavaScript, which are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components; entity tags, which are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to accelerate website performance; and HTML5 local storage, which allows data from websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><u>Your Choices</u><br>
We think that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we know more about you and what you like. However, you can limit the information you provide to us, and you can limit the communications that we send to you. In particular:</span></p>
