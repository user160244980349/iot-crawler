        <em>
            Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
        </em>
        <br/>
        To exercise your rights to access, data portability, or deletion, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Calling us toll-free at 833-904-0891;
        </li>

            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In order to enable us to consider your request, the request must:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Be verifiable:
            </strong>
            You must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Be specific:
            </strong>
            You must describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Be made by an authorized individual:
            </strong>
            Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify (1) your identity; (2) your authority to make the request on behalf of someone else; or (3) that the personal information relates to you.
        <br/>
        You may only make a consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
        <br/>
        <em>
            Response Timing and Format
        </em>
        <br/>
        We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
        <br/>
        We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option, to the extent the information is reasonably capable of delivery by your requested method.
        <br/>
        Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt of a verifiable request. If we cannot comply with a request, we will tell you why.
        <br/>
        We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive or repetitive. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
        <br/>
        Non-Discrimination
        <br/>
        We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights, by (1) Denying you goods or services; (2) Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; (3) Providing you with a different level or quality of goods or services; or (4) Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
        <br/>
        We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that
        <strong>
            can result
        </strong>
        in different prices, rates, or quality levels (e.g, one-time discounts for signing up to receive marketing emails). Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
