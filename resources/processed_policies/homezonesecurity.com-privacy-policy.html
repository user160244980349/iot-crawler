        </strong>
        We may work with third-party service providers who may use technologies described in this Privacy Statement above to conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Properties. For example, we use the third party providers as described above.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other information
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use our Properties, we may collect information about the browser you are using. We might track the pages you visit, look at what website you came from, or what website you visit when you leave us. We collect this information using the tracking tools described here to control those tools.
    </p>
    OUR TRACKING TECHNIQUES
    <p>
        Tracking Tools We Use
    </p>
    <p>
        We may collect personal and other information about users over time and across different websites when you use our Properties. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way through the methods described above. We or our vendors use several common online tracking tools to collect this information. These may include browser and flash cookies. We may also use web beacons and similar technologies. We use these tools:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To track new visitors to our websites.
        </li>
        <li>
            To recognize returning customers.
        </li>
        <li>
            To provide you with advertising content in which we think you will be interested. As part of this customization, we may observe your behaviors on this website or on other websites. We may also get information about your browsing history from our trusted business partners and vendors.
        </li>
        <li>
            So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors, and their respective interests.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Controlling Our Tracking Tools Via Your Browser
    </p>
    <p>
        Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you configure your computer to block cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Properties. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop. Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These browser features are not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.
    </p>
    WHEN INFORMATION IS COLLECTED
    <p>
        We collect information directly from you. The following are a few examples of when we may collect information from you:

            Shine the Light Disclosure.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.

        The California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with certain rights as described herein and in this Privacy Policy. The terms in this section use the definitions set forth in the CCPA.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CCPA provides California residents with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising rights to access and delete your personal information. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Services to you or we may need to retain it to comply with our own legal obligations.

    <p>
        Notice of Collection for California Residents.

        If you are a resident of California, you may request that we: provide you the categories of personal information we collect, disclose or sell about you, the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information. Such information is also set forth in this Privacy Policy; provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you; delete certain information we have about you; or provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.
    </p>
    <p>
        To exercise your rights or you would like further information regarding your legal rights, you may contact us at

            support@homezoneliving.com
        </a>
        . If you are a California resident, you may designate an agent to exercise your rights under the CCPA. We will take steps to verify the identity of the agent, and that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf. Such steps may include requiring that the agent submit a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney. Please note your rights and choices vary depending upon your location. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CCPA, and its accompanying regulations, specify that we should identify the categories of personal information we collect and purposes for which we may use it and the parties with which we share it.
