Third Party Data Collection and Interest Based Advertising.</h3>

<p>We engage in interest-based advertising and permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third party services, to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads on our Service, on other websites, apps or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. We may also use third party services to collect information about your browser or device, or your online activity on our Service so that we may enhance or personalize your experience, better understand the demographics of our users and how they interact with our Service, evaluate the success of our marketing campaigns, track reporting, referrals and attribution, and similar activities.</p>

<h4>Interest Based Advertising</h4>

<p>We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) with our third party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.</p>

<h4>Cross-Device Linking</h4>

<p>We, or our third party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We do this by collecting information about each device you use when you are logged in to our Service. We may also work with third party partners who employ tracking technologies, or the application of statistical modeling tools, to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) with third party advertising partners to help recognize you across devices. We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices, to perform analytics and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>Your Choices and Control Over Cookies, Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising Preferences</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Flash cookies</strong>.&nbsp;Most browsers allow you to adjust your browser settings to: (i) notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies.</p>

<p>Blocking or deleting cookies may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly.</p>

<p>Deleting cookies does not delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5. To manage Flash cookie settings and preferences, you must use the settings manager on Adobe’s website or by&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html">clicking here</a>. If you choose to delete Flash objects from our Service, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of the Service or benefit from the information and services offered.</p>

<p><strong>Interest-based advertising</strong>.&nbsp;To learn about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources</a>, and/or the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">DAA’s resources</a></p>

<p><strong>Cross-device linking</strong>.&nbsp;Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI’s and DAA’s online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices. You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile advertising</strong>.&nbsp;You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting&nbsp;<a href="http://youradchoices.com/appchoices">http://youradchoices.com/appchoices</a>&nbsp;and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.</p>

<p>Some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you may need to opt-out again.</p>

<h4>Social Media Widgets and Advertising</h4>

<p>Our Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter or other widgets. These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Service, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.</p>

<p>We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and others. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Service while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.</p>

<h4>Third Party Partners</h4>

<p>The following is a sample of the third party service partners we work with to provide cross-device linking and/or advertising services. We will strive to update this list if or when we work with new partners which offer you choices about the collection of your information, but as partners change and new technologies become available, this list is likely to change over time and may not always reflect our current partners.</p>

<p><strong>Google Analytics and Advertising</strong>. We use Google Analytics and Google Universal Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our site or Service on your browser or mobile device, login to your account on our Service, or otherwise engage with us.

<p>We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the Doubleclick advertising cookie) or other third party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Service. You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at&nbsp;<a href="https://google.com/ads/preferences">https://google.com/ads/preferences</a>&nbsp;or by vising NAI’s online resources at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service</strong>. We use Google Maps/Google Earth to help enhance your experience on our site or as you use the Service. Unless your browser is configured to prevent interaction these tools may automatically collect information about your location, including through IP address, GPS and other sensor data that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, WiFi access points and cell towers, in order to display relevant geographic information to you. This information is governed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html">Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.

Third Party Data Collection and Interest Based Advertising.</h3>\n\n<p>We engage in interest-based advertising and permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third party services, to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads on our Service, on other websites, apps or services you may use, and on other devices you may use.

Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) with our third party advertising partners to help identify you across devices.

We do this by collecting information about each device you use when you are logged in to our Service. We may also work with third party partners who employ tracking technologies, or the application of statistical modeling tools, to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) with third party advertising partners to help recognize you across devices.

You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mobile advertising</strong>.&amp;#160;You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting &amp;#8220;limit ad tracking&amp;#8221; (iOS) or &amp;#8220;opt-out of interest based ads&amp;#8221; (Android).

We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.
