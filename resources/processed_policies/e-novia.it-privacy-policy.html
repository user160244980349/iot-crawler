        Personal data processing notice
    </p>
    <p>
        With reference to processing data of users who visit our site www.e-novia.it (the “Site”) and use the “Work with us” section, in accordance with and due to the effects of Articles 13 and 14 of EU Regulation 2016/679, e-Novia SpA is providing the following notice:
    </p>
    <p>
        Type of data processed and purpose
    </p>
    <p>
        Browsing data
        <br/>
        During normal operation computer systems and software procedures used for keeping our Site working collect some personal information whose transmission is implicit in use of the Internet. This information is not collected to be associated with identified data subjects, but given their nature could allow for identifying users when processed and associated with data kept by others. Such data may be utilised by e-Novia for obtaining anonymous statistical information on use of our Site, to check that it is working properly or for ascertaining responsibility in case computer crimes are committed at the expense of our Site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data provided voluntarily by you in the “Work with us” section
        <br/>
        If you complete the form in the “Work with us” section of our Site, along with your CV e-Novia will obtain your personal data supplied directly and spontaneously by you. e-Novia will use the data collected for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <p>
        for assessing whether your profile is consistent with the positions indicated in the above section;
        <br/>
        for contacting you during the selection process, by using the contact data you provided. These data will be processed by employees and collaborators of e-Novia who look after personnel selection and have been duly appointed as processing delegates; your data will not be disseminated in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
        e-Novia suggests that users only include data on their CV that are necessary for evaluating their profile and not provide any sensitive data (such as those related to but not limited to state of health, religious beliefs and political opinions). At any rate, you are required to give your consent by putting the following sentence at the bottom of the CV you upload “Having read the notice of e-Novia found on the Internet site on the page http://www.e-novia.it/en/privacy/, I give my consent for processing of my data for the selection purposes specified therein”. Refusing to give authorisation can make it impossible for e-Novia to evaluate your application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other data supplied voluntarily by you
        <br/>
        Data you provide voluntarily as a user of this Site on registration forms or submit by email to e-Novia, e-mail addresses included, will be kept and processed only for supplying the information and/or services requested. In case you submit the personal data of third parties to e-Novia, you are acting like an independent data controller and assume all legal obligations and responsibilities. In this sense you hold the Data Controller harmless by any dispute, expectation, claim for damages due to processing, etc. sent to the Data Controller by third parties whose data were processed when you used our Site in violation of applicable personal data protection legislation. Also, if you provide or draw personal data of third parties when using our Site, you guarantee as of now – and assume all related responsibilities – that such particular case of processing is based, if necessary, on obtaining the consent of the third party beforehand for processing his or her information.
