    </p>
    Terminology used
    <p>
        USR’s data protection and privacy measures are governed by the (i) the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (
        <strong>
            “GDPR”
        </strong>
        ) and any national implementing laws, regulations and secondary legislation, as amended or updated from time to time, in the UK and then (ii) any successor legislation to the GDPR or the Data Protection Act 1998 (
        <strong>
            “Data Protection Legislation"
        </strong>
        ).
    </p>
    <p>
        For the purpose of Data Protection Legislation:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            where personal data is provided directly to USR through use of its Websites, email, or other means where USR is determining the way in which that personal data is processed, then USR will be a data controller of such information; and
        </li>
        <li>
            where USR is provided personal data in its capacity of providing Services to its customers, then USR will only process that personal data in accordance with the instructions of its customers and USR will therefore act as a data processor in respect of such personal data; USR’s customer will be the data controller of that personal data for that purpose.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Where USR acts as a data processor on behalf of its customers, USR will process that personal data on the instructions of the customer, who would have collected that personal data in accordance with that customer’s own privacy policy. The data subject should therefore check the customer’s own privacy policy, to ensure they understand how their personal data may be processed.
    </p>
    Information we collect
    <p>
        Personal data means any data or information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
    </p>
    <p>
        USR will only collect basic personal data about you, such as your name, email address, business type, work address, job title (
        <strong>
            “identity data”
        </strong>
        ) and any product/solution interests that you have shared (
        <strong>
            “preferences data”
        </strong>
        ) and information relating to your use of USR Websites (
        <strong>
            “usage data”
        </strong>
        ). Unless otherwise agreed with you, this information will not include any special categories of personal information (often known as
        <strong>
            “sensitive personal data”
        </strong>
        ).

    </p>
    How we use information that we collect
    <p>

If USR needs to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, USR will notify you and will explain the legal basis which allows it to do this. Please note that USR may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, where this is required or permitted by law.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            With permitted third party contractors of USR for the purposes of performing its Services;
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
            To protect the rights, property, or safety of USR, USR’s customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and for compliance with laws; and
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>
    How long we keep your information for
    <p>
        Where USR acts as a data controller, it will not keep your personal information longer than is necessary for the purpose in which it was provided, unless required by law, or for other legitimate reasons that need it to be retained for longer (for example, if necessary for any legal proceedings). Where USR acts as a data processor on behalf of its customers, USR will only hold on to personal data for the period notified to USR by the data controller customer, or for the period required for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, regulatory or reporting requirements.
