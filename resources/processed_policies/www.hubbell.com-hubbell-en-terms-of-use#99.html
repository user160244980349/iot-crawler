    <p>
        Some of the information contained in this Website is provided to Hubbell Incorporated and its affiliates by third parties. It is not possible for Hubbell Incorporated and its affiliates to check exhaustively the accuracy of all information provided by third parties. Inaccuracies may arise in that information in different ways, and those inaccuracies may not be evident to users of this Website. Although we may provide links to other websites (
        <strong>
            "Linked Sites"
        </strong>
        ) as a matter of convenience for our users, Hubbell has no control over these Linked Sites and we do not necessarily share their viewpoints and cannot guarantee the accuracy or authenticity of the information within those websites. Use these Linked Sites at your own risk. The presence of a Linked Site on the Website does not and should not be taken as implying an endorsement or approval of the content of the Linked Site by Hubbell, the activities of the organizations and businesses responsible for those websites, or any policies associated with such websites whether or not those policies are published. Under no circumstances is Hubbell Incorporated responsible or liable for any privacy, intellectual property, or other policy of a Linked Site provided on a Hubbell Incorporated Website or a website of a company affiliated with Hubbell Incorporated.
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that Hubbell shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings with third parties. If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you understand and agree that Hubbell is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you hereby release Hubbell, its officers, employees, agents, and successors in rights from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."

        <strong>
            - There are inherent security risks with on-line services
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Hubbell Incorporated has three types of security associated with its websites. One type is for a publicly available website - no login is required, and there is no encryption of any information. The second type is semi-secure - a login system requires a user ID and a password, but there is no encryption of any exchanged information. The third type of website has the highest security - a login system is used with an encrypted data communication system based on Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") encryption. This highest level of security would be used where financial information and orders are involved. Highly secured sites will generally have a URL that begins with https://. . ., and some browsers will show an icon of a closed lock to indicate a secured connection.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should be aware, however, that there are some inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet, and with using SSL as the encryption mechanism. If you do not wish to use any of the Hubbell Incorporated company online services, you can transact with us by mail at the address listed in the Contact Us section of these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an effort to protect your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. As a result, although we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the personal information against any possible loss or unauthorized access.

            - Fees and Payment
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Although some of our services are currently free to users, Hubbell reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain or all services. You shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Website in connection with such services selected by you. Hubbell reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the Website. Your use of the services following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable.

            Acceptable Use Guidelines.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        As a condition to your use of the Website, you agree to follow our Acceptable Use Guidelines, set out below. Under these Guidelines, you will not:
    </p>
    <p>
        Upload, email or otherwise transmit any images or other user content that is unlawful, obscene, harmful, hateful, invades the privacy of any third party, contains nudity or pornography or is otherwise objectionable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Disseminate materials that impact or invade the privacy of others, such as photographs, video clips, sound recordings, personally identifiable information, or other materials that reveal personal, private or sensitive information about another person, without that person's consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Submit material that is intentionally false, defamatory, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Infringe any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy. Electronic materials – such as music, videos, games, images and text in electronic form – can easily be copied, modified and sent over networks (such as the internet). These electronic materials are thus extremely vulnerable to unauthorized distribution and copyright infringement. These materials may not be transmitted over the Website without the copyright owner's permission or without a legitimate "fair use" justification for the transmittal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Transmit materials that contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer-programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the Website to artificially generate traffic or page links to a website or for any other purpose not expressly allowed under these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the Website in a manner that could disable, overburden or impair the Website or Services or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of the Website and Services, such as through sending "spam."
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the Website to test or reverse engineer the Website in order to find limitations, vulnerabilities or to evade filtering capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Seek to obtain access to any materials or information through "hacking", "data harvesting" or through other means we have not intentionally made available to you through the Website, including use of manual or automated software, devices, or other processes to "crawl," "scrape," or "spider" any page of the Website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the Website for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms. For example, you will not use the Website to violate any law, statute or regulation (including, without limitation, those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or false advertising).

            Monitoring; Revocation or Suspension of Use Privileges.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Although we have no – and assume no – obligation to monitor activities on the Website, we reserve the right at any time to (i) monitor your use of the Website, and (ii) terminate or suspend your use of some or all of the Website or Services if you engage in activities that we conclude, in our discretion, breach our Acceptable Use Guidelines or otherwise violate these Terms or our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should also understand that our Acceptable Use Guidelines are based in many instances on principles of applicable law. Violations of our Acceptable Use Guidelines accordingly may expose you to criminal charges, and civil liability to harmed parties for compensatory damages and attorney's fees. Hubbell reserves the right at all times to disclose information it deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, consistent with our Privacy Policy.

        Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent: If the content provider or user believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider or user, must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed above:
    </p>
    <p>
        A. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider or user;
    </p>
    <p>
        B. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;
    </p>
    <p>
        C. A statement that the content provider or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and
    </p>
    <p>
        D. Content provider's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's or user's address is located, or, if the content provider's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Hubbell may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Hubbell may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Hubbell's discretion.

    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to these Terms, any sweepstakes, contests, raffles or similar promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through the Website may be governed by specific rules that are separate from these Terms. By participating in any such Promotion, you will become subject to those rules, which may vary from the terms and conditions set forth herein. Hubbell urges you to review any specific rules applicable to a particular Promotion, which will be linked from such Promotion, and to review our Privacy Policy, which, in addition to these Terms, governs any information you submit in connection with such Promotion. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such Promotion rules conflict with these Terms, the terms and conditions of such Promotion rules shall control.
    </p>
    <p>
        Promotions, discount rules or coupon codes for a free gift with purchase will result in one free gift per order, not per item, unless otherwise noted. Only one coupon code, discount rule or promotion may be used per order, unless otherwise noted. Promotions, discount rules and coupon codes are valid only to the listed expiration date. Promotional/Coupon codes are subject to change at any time. In order to receive a free item with a promo code, the item must be added to your shopping cart and the promo code added during checkout; cost of the free item will be taken off of your total.

            Termination.
        </strong>

Hubbell may terminate or suspend your access to the Website or services or your account at any time, for any reason, and without warning, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your account.

            Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION.
        </strong>
        The parties to these Terms agree that final and binding arbitration on an individual basis shall be the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for any and all disputes and claims that cannot be resolved informally and that relate in any way to or arise out of your use of the Website or these Terms. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to arbitrations under these terms and conditions (despite any other choice of law provision).
    </p>
    <p>
        Arbitration under these terms and conditions shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). For claims of less than or equal to $75,000 (exclusive of attorney's fees, costs, and alleged punitive damages or penalties), the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at https://www.adr.org. Any Notice of Arbitration should be mailed to us at the following address: Hubbell Incorporated Attn: General Counsel, 40 Waterview Drive, Shelton, CT 06484.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
        </strong>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, arbitration shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any disputes to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Disputes may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event that this CLASS ACTION WAIVER is deemed unenforceable, then any putative class action may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction without a jury and not in arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            WAIVER OF RIGHTS, INCLUDING TO TRIAL BY JURY.
        </strong>
        By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes. The rules in arbitration are different. There is no judge or jury, and review of an arbitrator's decision is very limited. We both further agree that, whether a claim will be resolved in arbitration or in court, the parties both waive any right to a jury trial involving any claims or disputes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            General.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Connecticut without giving effect to its conflicts of law provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. Hubbell's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. These Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between Hubbell and you with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior or contemporaneous understanding, whether written or oral.

The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do-not-track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized.

        Browser cookies are small pieces data placed on your computer as you navigate websites with your browser. Browser cookies allow websites and various third-parties to distinguish your device from others by having the cookie consist of a unique identifier or other data. Cookies can have many uses, such as to target advertising as well as to enable website functionality and for security. We use both session cookies (which expire after you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. (Each browser is different, so check the "help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Hubbell Incorporated products or services that require you to "sign in", and some areas of our website may not work properly, and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings.

            - Local shared objects.
        </em>
        Local shared objects (such as "Flash" cookies) are associated with non-Browser software like Flash Player. Local shared objects can be used like cookies to distinguish your device from others but will not be deleted or blocked using browser cookie controls. You can visit adobe.com for guidance on how to delete and block Flash cookies.

            - HTML5 local storage.
        </em>
        HTML5 local storeage is another way that browsers can distinguish your device from others as well as remember data that may be important for the functioning of the website. Typically HTML5 local storage is only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted. You should check your browser software for how to delete HTML5 local storage in your particular case.

        <em>
            - Web beacons.
        </em>
        Web beacons are image files that are used by third-party advertisers, analytics companies, and others. Web beacons are embedded in web pages you visit and cause your browser to share its IP address with the third-party source of the beacon, together with any cookies associated with that third-party. Web beacons can be used with or without cookies. Blocking cookies will not stop your IP address from being shared through the use of beacons.

    <p>
        <em>
            - E-tags.
        </em>
        E-tags are used to prevent duplicative downloading of content to your browser, which can enhance browser performance. E-tags use unique identifiers for content that can also be used to distinguish your browser in certain instances from others. Typically e-tags are only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted. You should check your browser software for how to delete e-tags in your particular case.
