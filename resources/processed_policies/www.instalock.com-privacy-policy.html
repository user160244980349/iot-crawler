        <strong>
            SECTION 5 – THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
        <br/>
        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
        <br/>
        For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
        <br/>
        In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
        <br/>
        As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
    </p>
    <p>

        <strong>
            SECTION 6 – SECURITY
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.
        <br/>
        If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption.

            SECTION 7 – COOKIES
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, WooCommerce uses the following cookies:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. woocommerce_cart_hash
        <br/>
        The WooCommerce Cart Hash cookie contains information about the shopping cart. In other words, it memorizes what you added to your cart. Also, it helps WooCommerce know when the cart data changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. woocommerce_items_in_cart
        <br/>
        The WooCommerce Item in cart cookie has the same value as the WooCommerce Cart Hash. Both of them keep the cart information and allows you to properly use the cart feature. Without them, you would not be able to add multiple products to your cart or make any changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. wp_woocommerce_session_
        <br/>
        This cookie contains a unique code for each customer. The WooCommerce session cookie knows where to find the cart data in the database for each customer. In other words, without it, shopping in WooCommerce wouldn’t be as effective and functional as it is now.
    </p>
