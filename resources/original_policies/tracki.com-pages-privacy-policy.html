<p>This Privacy Policy applies to users of the Tracki™ products and applications. Tracki Inc, a Delaware, USA company, is the developer and the owner of all the commercial rights to the applications and products sold under the Tracki™ Brand.</p>
<p>Tracki Inc (“<strong>We</strong>”,&nbsp; “<strong>Our</strong>”,&nbsp; “<strong>Tracki</strong>” or “<strong>The Company</strong>”)&nbsp; &nbsp;have updated &nbsp;our privacy policy to include additional information required under&nbsp; applicable Data protection regulations – including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why we process personal data</li>
<li>Legal grounds for processing personal data</li>
<li>European union user rights under the GDPR and how to exercise them</li>
<li>Contact information for Tracki data controllers</li>
<li>Contact information for the Tracki data protection officer in the European union</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<p><strong>Categories of Personal Data Processed by Tracki</strong></p>
<p>Personal data that is processed when you create a Tracki account:<br> When you create a Tracki account, we ask you to provide your email address and name. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish.</p>
<p>PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUND 1:</p>
<p>(a) Tracki processes your email address because you use your email address and your password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is based on Tracki’s legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account.</p>
<p>(b) Tracki also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Tracki products, apps or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile, and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on a Tracki website or app. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is Tracki’s legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your Tracki products, apps or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy, and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other Tracki users.</p>
<p>(c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from Tracki, Tracki will also process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about Tracki products and apps. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your preferences in your Tracki account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from Tracki are based on the preferences you provide in your Tracki account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of Tracki devices you have added to your Tracki account, and any subscriptions included in your Tracki account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is Tracki’s legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.</p>
<p>(d) Tracki also processes your email address to associate it with your Tracki account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>Personal data that is processed when you sign in to your Tracki account with Social Media Credentials if you choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may choose to sign in to your Tracki account using your social media sign in credentials (e.g., your Facebook sign in credentials). If you choose to do this, the first time you do so you will be asked whether you agree that the social media provider may provide certain information to Tracki, such as your name, email address, profile photo, posts, comments and other information associated with your social media account.</li>
<li>All of this information is made available to Tracki by the social media provider due to the way the social sign-on configuration works. However, the only information Tracki retains and processes is your email address. If you do not want your information to be shared with Tracki by the social media provider, then you can simply sign in to your Tracki account using your Tracki account credentials instead of your social media account credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracki associates the email address provided by the social media provider with your Tracki account so that you can use your email address to sign in to your Tracki account in the future if you no longer wish to sign in using your social media account credentials. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is Tracki’s legitimate interest in providing you an alternative sign in method and in securing your account.</li>
<li>Personal data that is processed when you sync your Tracki device:</li>
<li>When you sync your device, we log data about the transmission, such as the IP address used when syncing, the sync time and date, crash/diagnostic logs, geographic location of the device, information about your device, information about the network used to sync (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular) and device battery level.</li>
</ul>
<p>PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND 3:</p>
<p>We process this information to help identify and resolve errors or syncing issues. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is Tracki’s legitimate interest in resolving errors or syncing issues and providing quality product support.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>Personal data that is processed when you communicate with Tracki:</p>
<p>When you interact with our customer support representatives via email, telephone, online or in person, we collect personal data, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address and contact preferences; and information about the Tracki products you own, such as their device ID and date of purchase. We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance-related issues, and capture information relating to the support or service issue. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives, and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys. With your consent, our customer support representatives may sign in to your Tracki account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND 4:</p>
<p>We use this information to provide you with customer and product support and to monitor the quality and types of customer and product support we provide to our customers. The legal ground for processing this information for these purposes is Tracki’s legitimate interests in providing quality product support. The legal ground for signing in to your Tracki account, if appropriate, to help troubleshoot and resolve your issue is consent, which you may withdraw.</p>
<p>Personal data that is processed when you use your Tracki auto navigation device or app:</p>
If you use a Tracki device or app and provide your consent, then Tracki will collect and upload from your device data such as location, speed, direction, and time and date of recording. If you provide your consent when asked, then Tracki may also share this aggregated data with or sell this data to third parties to enhance the quality of the traffic, parking and other features enabled by content providers.
<ul></ul>
<p>PURPOSE AND LEGAL GROUND 5:</p>
<p>This data is aggregated with data from other consenting users and is used to enhance the quality of our products and apps and the traffic, parking and other features enabled by Tracki or third parties.

The legal ground for processing your name, mailing address and telephone number for these purposes is performance of a contract.

Because anyone with access to the link will be able to see the real-time location of your Tracki device, you should use caution in determining to whom you want to send the link and be sure that you trust them to not send the link to others whom you do not want to be able to view the location of your Tracki device.</p>
</div>

Tracki uses this data to analyze the level of engagement with its emails. Tracki uses third-party service providers to ship purchased products to customers and to help us better understand our customers needs.</p>
