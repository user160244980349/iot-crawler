    Device Operation

During this process, we will ask you to create a username and password and provide certain information necessary to establish and use your account, which may include your name, telephone number, physical and email address, and other information to identify and protect you.

This information will only be stored on your mobile device, and will not be collected and stored in our cloud or servers. If you disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your mobile device, Service functionality, such as the geofencing feature, reminders to lock your doors when you leave your home and asking you if you’d like to unlock your door when you return home, may not work.
    </p>
    Other Users
    <p>
        As part of our Services, you may grant another user and guest (collectively, “other users”) access to your Hampton device. If you provide other users with access to your Hampton device, certain elements of your information, device, and Service information may be shared with them in order for them to understand the invite and access the device. We may also share their information with you. We may also collect personal information (as required to use our Service as set forth in this Privacy Policy) about the other users to allow them to have access to your Hampton device and Service. All such information (including their Service usage information) is subject to, and will be used and disclosed as set forth in, this Privacy Policy. All users expressly consent to such use and disclosure as a user of our Service. If you are another user or guest and do not consent to such use, do not use the Service. Other users should be aware that you may be able to see information about their usage of your Hampton device and our Service and can terminate their access without notice. Other users should also be aware that their personal information and usage information may be shared with third-party service providers as set forth in this Privacy Policy, including those service providers you have selected.

These third parties may have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

    </p>
    Data Storage and Transfer
    <p>
        Your personal information is processed and stored in servers located in the United States. We do not store or process your personal information on servers and equipment in other countries outside the United States. If you choose to use our Services outside the United States and choose to provide information to Hampton, please be advised that although personal information is ultimately transferred to the United States, the information may be processed in another country, which may be subject by different laws and pose different safety risks. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information indicates your understanding and acceptance of such risks.
    </p>
    Security
    <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us. Generally-accepted industry standards are used to protect the transmission, collection, and storage of your personal information. Dual encryption methods may be used on some Services to provide an additional layer of security. However, no method of transmission over the phone, Internet, and method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Your consent to this Privacy Policy indicates your understanding and acceptance of such risks.
    </p>
    Your California Privacy Rights
    <p>
        The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) affords the Californian consumer specific rights regarding personal information. These rights have been described in this policy overall and are further highlighted in this section. If you have a specific question or concern about your rights, or questions about our policy in support of your rights as a Californian consumer, please contact us through our website at www.hampton.care/privacy or by phone at 800-562-5625.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is Personal Information under the CCPA?
    </p>
    <p>
        “Personal information” is anything that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your Rights with regard to your Personal Information:
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right as a Californian consumer to expect disclosures as to how we collect, use and care for personal data and we have provided these disclosures in the above sections of our Privacy Notice.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can continue to expect us to disclose how we collect personal information and the sources from which we may obtain that information, and the specific personal information or categories of information that we have collected. You have a right to the disclosure of the business or commercial purposes we have for collecting personal information, the legal basis on which we do so, disclosure of the categories of personal information that have been transferred, shared or disclosed in the preceding 12-month period for commercial purposes, and the categories of recipients to which that personal information has been disclosed, shared, or transferred.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CCPA requires opt in consent to data use for minors under the age of 16 and verified parental consent for children under the age of 13. If notified that children have provided data without appropriate process and consent, it will be deleted as immediately as practicable on advisement. Lastly, you have the right to ask what information we have about you specifically.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may exercise these rights without concern. You cannot be denied benefits or services or charged differently for doing so. We, or our partners, on verification of your identity and legitimate standing to make the request, and if not an undue or unreasonable hardship for the company, shall act on your request, or at a very minimum, advise you as to why we cannot. There are specific reasons under the law which prevent accommodation of some requests, but if denied, we will advise as to why, to whom you may submit a complaint, and your options for challenge, redress or escalation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            You may make a verifiable request to exercise the following rights, free of charge to you, twice in a 12-month period, and we are obligated to respond within a period of 45 days.
        </strong>
