        Even within Spracht, we restrict access to your information to those individuals who

        Mobile Privacy

        Spracht may offer mobile applications (commonly known as "apps") that allow you to

    <h2>
        Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Similar Technologies
    </h2>
    <p>
        Our website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology. We use cookies and web
        <br/>
        beacons to distinguish you from other visitors, track your IP address and usage of our
        <br/>
        site, and to identify the name of the Web site from which you linked to
        <br/>
        StagOutdoor.com. This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business
        <br/>
        partners, and to help us serve you better by improving our website design, as well as
        <br/>
        our products, services, and promotions. We do not otherwise track any information
        <br/>
        about your use of other websites.
        <br/>
        A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you
        <br/>
        visit a website. A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e.,
        <br/>
        close your browser). A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when
        <br/>
        you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie
        <br/>
        information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a
        <br/>
        clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie.
        <br/>
        When you visit our website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This
        <br/>
        Spracht-placed cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used
        <br/>
        to track your usage of our website and in some cases, your e-mail address. Your e-mail
        <br/>
        address is only saved in this Spracht-placed cookie if you register with us. A web
        <br/>
        beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's
        <br/>
        actions on a web site, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time, date, duration and
        <br/>
        number of page views, a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed, and
        <br/>
        details about any items that were purchased.
        <br/>
        If you register with us, this Spracht-placed cookie allows us to recognize you when you
        <br/>
        return to our website and provides you with access to your account information. If you
        <br/>
        save your information with or order from us, we may also use cookies to monitor and
        <br/>
        maintain information about your use of our website. If you have not saved your
        <br/>
        information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about
        <br/>
        your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you. You can disable cookies
        <br/>
        at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not
        <br/>
        be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our website. In
        <br/>
        addition, we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access
        <br/>
        to your account information.

        We may use Flash Cookies (also known as Local Stored Objects) or other similar
        <br/>
        technologies. A Flash cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe
        <br/>
        Flash technology that may be built into your computer or downloaded by you to your
        <br/>
        computer. We use these technologies to personalize and enhance your online

        experience, facilitate processes, personalize and store your settings. They help us
        <br/>
        improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to customers.
        <br/>
        We do not use Flash cookies for marketing or behavioral targeting purposes. Flash cookies
        <br/>
        are different from browser cookies and the cookie management tools provided by your
        <br/>

        We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality

        and security of personally identifiable information transmitted to us using this website.
        <br/>
        To guard your information, our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts
        <br/>
        your credit card number, name and address so only Spracht is able to decode your
        <br/>
        information. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a
        <br/>
        secure means of transmitting credit card information.
        <br/>
        To be sure your connection is secure, look at the bottom status bar of your browser
        <br/>
        window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) the
        <br/>
        SSL is active and your information is secure. Most browsers offer additional security
        <br/>
        alerts as well.
        <br/>
        Additionally, we are asking all our customers to take measures to help protect personal
        <br/>
        information in their online accounts, including the following:

        Business Transitions
    </h2>
    <p>
        As we continue to develop our business, we may undergo a business transition such as
        <br/>
        acquiring another company, merging with an existing company, or selling a portion of
        <br/>
        our assets. In such transitions, customer information is typically one of the business
        <br/>
        assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. In the unlikely event that Spracht
        <br/>
        or substantially all of its assets are acquired or enter a court proceeding, you
        <br/>
        acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that your Personal Information can

        continue to be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
