            </strong>
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain information, such as personal information and payment information, is collected directly from you when you provide it to us or our third-party payment processing services. Other information, such as certain device information and technical information, is collected automatically when you interact with our Products and Services. We may also use automatic data collection technologies on our Website and our Apps to collect certain technical information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Details of your visits to our Website and Apps, including traffic data, location data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Website and Apps.

    <p>

Some Internet browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features which send a signal or preference to websites indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Please note that the HeathCo does not respond to or take any action with respect to any browser Do-Not-Track signals.

        The information we collect automatically is only statistical data and does not include personal information. It helps us to improve our Products and Services and to deliver a better and more personalized service. The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:
