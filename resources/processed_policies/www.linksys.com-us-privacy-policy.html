    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            Aggregated Information.
        </em>
        Information may be aggregated and/or anonymized. When information is aggregated, it is combined with information about other customers and users. Aggregated information that includes Personal Information is considered Personal Information until it has been anonymized.

        </em>
        When information is anonymized, Personal Information is removed from collected data and the remaining portion of the data is repurposed for internal or external use, such as to determine how many users of a particular router include an Internet-enabled television in a home network environment, or how many users viewed a particular website video or advertisement. Anonymized information cannot be used to identify you.

        Belkin uses automatic data collection tools such as cookies, embedded web links and widgets. These tools collect certain information that your browser or your mobile device sends to Belkin websites and Belkin Products.
    </p>
    <p>
        This privacy policy explains the types of cookies we collect and the purpose for collecting them. Our websites allow you to manage your cookie preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some websites have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals.

    <h3>
        Security
    </h3>
    <p>
        We strive to maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the information collected by Belkin websites and Belkin products. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not 100% secure. If you use a computer or device that can be accessed by others, other people may be able to access unencrypted Personal Information. If you do not want your information to be available to others, exercise caution when using public computers or devices or when using any computer or device to which users unauthorized by you may have access.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend that you take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, create strong passwords by using a combination of letters, numbers and symbols, change your passwords often, and make sure you use a secure browser. When creating a password for your home network, make sure you choose a unique password that you do not use for other Internet-based services and websites. You should also be aware that names that you give your WiFi-enabled devices, home networks and services (also known as "friendly names") may be detectable by Linksys and by others outside your home, so you should not use Personal Information as part of your friendly names.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information, we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Links to Other Sites
    </h3>
    <p>
        Belkin websites and online services may contain links to websites or online services operated by Belkin (such as Linksys, Wemo or Playa) or operated by other Belkin affiliated companies. Belkin websites and services may also include links to websites operated by, and/or use or offer products and services from third parties, such as a third party app that works with a Belkin product. Once you leave Belkin websites and Belkin products, your activities are governed by the terms of use and privacy policies of the third party websites and online services. Belkin is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites and online services, and we encourage you to carefully read the terms of use and privacy policies of any website and online service you visit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Belkin websites and Belkin products may contain social media features, such as Facebook "Like" buttons. These features may collect information about your device's IP address, set cookies to facilitate interaction with social media features or link you to a social media website where you may post Personal Information. All interactions with social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the social media company providing the feature.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Forums/Chat Rooms
    </h3>
    <p>
        If you participate in or post information to a discussion forum or chat room on any Belkin website or Belkin product, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, and can be read, collected, forwarded or used by other users of these forums, potentially inside or outside Belkin, who have access to that forum. This information could also be used to send you unsolicited messages. Please recognize that individual forums may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Belkin. We are not responsible for Personal Information or any other information you may choose to submit in these forums, or the consequences of any submission. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please contact us

        Cookie List
    </h3>
    A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information. Those cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies. We also use third-party cookies – which are cookies from a domain different than the domain of the website you are visiting – for our advertising and marketing efforts. More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:  Strictly Necessary Cookies
    <p>
        These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
