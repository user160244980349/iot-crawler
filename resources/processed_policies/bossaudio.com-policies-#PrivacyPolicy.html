        30-Days Service Policy
    </h3>
    <p>
        If your product fails within 30 days of purchase, BOSS AUDIO Systems will gladly pay for shipping both ways, to repair or replace your unit. In this case, you need to contact us within 30 days of your purchase to obtain a Return Authorization number (RA#). We use ground shipping with tracking numbers.

        1-Year Free Parts &amp; Labor
    </h3>
    <p>
        All BOSS AUDIO Systems products purchased in the United States are warranted for a period of one year from the purchase date against defects in materials and workmanship. We will provide you with free parts and labor for one year after your purchase. The warranty is for repair or replacement at the sole discretion of the selling dealer. If we choose to replace your product, we may replace it with a new or reconditioned unit of the same or similar design. The customer is responsible for freight charges incurred to return the product. For all other countries, contact our technical support where you must send a copy of the original invoice with the date of purchase. Please enclose a letter stating the problem you are having with the product, your daytime phone number, and your return shipping address (no P.O. Box). Contact us to receive an RA# before sending your defective item. This warranty does not cover any unit subject to abuse, neglect, incorrect wiring, water and/or physical damage, or any repair or modification performed by someone other than a BOSS AUDIO Systems repair technician. Any damages resulting from legal action for breach of expressed or implied warranties shall be limited to the cost of the original purchase price of the unit. As a condition of this warranty, it is agreed that the remedy provided in this document is the sole remedy under this warranty. All liability for coincidental damages is excluded. The purchaser agrees to retain the original proof-of-purchase for establishing the effective date of this warranty. Should BOSS AUDIO Systems or an authorized dealer replace your product under warranty, this replacement shall be considered a transaction under the original warranty and does not extend the original warranty period. This warranty is non-transferable.

        We take your safety and security seriously. We accept payment by Visa, Master Card, American Express, Discover, PayPal and PayPal Credit. Sorry, no COD orders. We do not accept credit card numbers delivered by email. You should never send credit card numbers by email, as this is not a secure practice. The billing address you provide must match the billing address that is on file with the financial institution that issued the credit card. If a credit card authorization fails, we reserve the right to cancel your order without notifying you. We cannot resolve credit card problems with your financial institution if a credit card is declined.

        OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
    </strong>
    Other technologies used include clear GIF’s and IP address logging. Clear GIF’s, also known as web bugs, beacons, or tags, are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an e-mail message. Clear GIF’s are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1×1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document, or e-mail message. We do not use clear GIF’s to collect personal information about you. However, we may use clear GIF’s to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features, or other elements on a web page. We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience or for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.
