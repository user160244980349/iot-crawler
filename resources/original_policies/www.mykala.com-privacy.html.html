    <h5 id="DEFINITIONS_TERMS">
      <strong>DEFINITIONS &amp; TERMS</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>“Kala” means the Kala Online Retail Marketplace program owned and provided by Triliant, LLC and
      accessed by you under this agreement via the MyKala.com website, the Kala mobile application, and other access
      points.</p>
    <p>“Vendors” means, collectively, third parties that perform business operations on behalf of Triliant,
      such as transaction processing, billing, mailing, communications services (e-mail, direct mail, etc.), marketing,
      data processing and analytics, servicing, collections, or ad management.</p>
    <p>"Business Partners" means, collectively, the retailers, merchants, service organizations, consumer goods
      companies, and other third party businesses enrolled in or employed by Kala to perform services on our behalf.
      Examples include 3
      <sup>rd</sup> party sellers who list products and fulfill orders, as well as service organizations used to process
      payments, track your order shipments, provide customer service support, and send messages and communications such
      as email.</p>
    <h5 id="INFORMATION_COLLECTED_OR">
      <strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED OR RECEIVED</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>
      <strong>Information you give us.&nbsp; </strong>In order to use Kala’s services, we require certain
      information to register and place orders such as your name, email address, date of birth, gender, mailing address,
      and payment methods.&nbsp; You may review and modify this information through your account settings at any time.
      We also collect other information that does not personally identify you, such as those relating to your product
      interests, personal preferences, and deal offers. When you provide personal information through Kala, the
      information may be sent to servers located in other countries around the world.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Information we get from your use of Kala.</strong> We may collect information about the services that you
      use and how you use them, like when you visit the Kala website, mobile app, or the website of one of our Business
      Partners. This information includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information - we may collect information from your mobile device or browser when you install, access,
        or otherwise visit the Kala site or mobile app, including your IP address, location data or your device
        identifier. Kala may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your account. This information may
        be used to provide you with a more personalized experience and product offers, to combat and prevent fraudulent
        activity, or to better understand how Kala’s services are working for our members and visitors. If you
        have provided consent to share your device location but no longer wish to continue sharing that information with
        us, you may revoke your consent to the sharing of that information through the settings on the Apps or on your
        mobile device</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Log information – when you use Kala or view content provided by Kala, we may automatically collect and
        store certain information in server logs. This may include details of how you used Kala so we can continue to
        provide better experiences and new functionality for our members.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Local storage – we may collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as
        browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. We use various technologies to collect and
        store information when you visit a Kala service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous
        identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we
        offer to our partners, such as Kala features that may appear on other sites.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Information we gather from third parties.&nbsp; </strong>We may also periodically obtain both personal and
      non-personal information about you from Business Partners, contractors and other third parties. Examples of
      information that we may receive include social media information and purchasing data.</p>
    <h5 id="INFORMATION_USES">
      <strong>INFORMATION USES</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>We (or our Vendors on our behalf), use information collected about you, as described in this Privacy and Data Use
      Policy, to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operate, maintain and improve our services;</li>
      <li>Provide you with personalized offers and recommendations for products and services from us and participating
        Business Partners;</li>
      <li>Evaluate and analyze your eligibility for certain types of offers, products or services that may be of
        interest to you, and analyze advertising effectiveness;</li>
      <li>Answer your questions and respond to your requests;</li>
      <li>Perform analytics and conduct customer research;</li>
      <li>Communicate and provide additional information that may be of interest to you about Kala and our Business
        Partners;</li>
      <li>Send you reminders, notifications and updates, security alerts, customer support and administrative messages,
        service bulletins, marketing messages, and requested information, including on behalf of Business Partners;</li>
      <li>Administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, reviews, or other promotional activities or events
        sponsored by us or our Business Partners;</li>
      <li>Manage our everyday business needs, such as administration of Kala, analytics, fraud prevention, and
        enforcement of our corporate reporting obligations and Terms of Service, or to comply with the law; and to</li>
      <li>Allow you to post content or sign up for special offers from merchants, Business Partners, or third parties
        through Kala.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="COMMUNICATIONS">
      <strong>COMMUNICATIONS</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>We hate getting spam as much as you do – in fact it’s one of the reasons we created Kala. From time
      to time, however, we may need to contact you with information, announcements and updates, or support requests
      about your account or orders. Examples of such messages include order confirmations, customer support requests and
      follow ups, shipping notifications, and policy changes. These messages are typically delivered by email, text, or
      other push notification. Every account is required to maintain a valid email address with kala to ensure you
      receive these messages.</p>
    <p>You may elect to opt-out of ongoing communications from us, such as offers, newsletters, subscriptions, account
      information, promotional materials, contest results, survey inquiries, etc. by using a simple “opt
      out” procedure within Kala’s “My Account” page. You may choose to subscribe to some types
      of messages, and may choose to unsubscribe from others at any time.&nbsp;However, if you opt-out of receiving our
      announcements and updates about your account, you may no longer have access to areas restricted to account
      members.&nbsp; If you wish to opt out of receiving offers directly from our&nbsp;Business Partners, you may
      opt-out by following the instructions in the emails that they send you.</p>
    <h5 id="YOUR_CHOICES">
      <strong>YOUR CHOICES &amp; CONTROL</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>We know that our members should have control over their own information, which is why Kala gives you the choice
      of providing, editing or removing certain information, as well as options about how you’re contacted. You
      may change or update your account information through your account settings, and may also remove certain optional
      information that you no longer wish to be publicly visible through Kala.</p>
    <p>Kala may send communications to you about our services or your activity, some of which are required,
      service-related notification for members such as transactional messages or legal notices. Other communications,
      such as newsletters and product review reminders, are not required. You can control whether you receive these
      optional messages by modifying your notification options in your “my account” page.</p>
    <p>If you no longer wish to use the Services or receive service-related messages, then you may elect to close your
      account.</p>
    <h5 id="SHARING_DISCLOSURE">
      <strong>SHARING &amp; DISCLOSURE</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>While Kala is committed to protecting your personal privacy, there are certain occasions where we (or our Vendors
      on our behalf) may share information collected about you, or the results or our evaluation and analysis of such
      information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As required or permitted by law:</li>
      <li>With our Vendors to provide services for us and who are required to protect your information;</li>
      <li>With Business Partners to 1) facilitate a direct relationship with you, including in connection with any
        program we administer on behalf of the Business Partner, and 2) to enable electronic communications with you as
        part of purchase, offer, contest, program, or other activity in which you have elected to participate;</li>
      <li>With a purchaser of Triliant (or its assets);</li>
      <li>To comply with legal orders and government requests, or as needed to support auditing, compliance, and
        corporate governance functions;</li>
      <li>To combat fraud or criminal activity, and to protect our rights or those of our Affiliates, users, and
        Business Partners, or as part of legal proceedings affecting Triliant;</li>
      <li>In response to a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and
        courts in the United States and other countries where we operate; or</li>
      <li>With your consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We encourage Business Partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, their use of your information
      obtained through Kala is governed by their privacy policies and is not subject to our control.</p>
    <p>We may share aggregated, non-personal information in any of the above situations and also with advertisers and
      others.</p>
    <p>If you post information about yourself or others, or communicate with others using our website, please note that
      we cannot always control who reads your postings or what they do with the information you provide. We encourage
      you to use caution in posting personal information.</p>
    <h5 id="CHILDREN">
      <strong>CHILDREN</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>Kala is not intended for use by people under the age of 18, nor do we knowingly collect personal information from
      anyone under 18. We do not intentionally orient Kala toward children or target them as an audience, nor are we
      able to necessarily screen them from using Kala. Some material on Kala may be intended for mature audiences, and
      parents and guardians should take responsibility for monitoring their children’s use. Kala does not collect
      or distribute information indicating whether a user is a child.</p>
    <h5 id="SECURITY">
      <strong>SECURITY</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>Kala works hard to protect the security of your personal information and prevent unauthorized access to our
      systems and to your account. In order to further limit access and provide more robust security, your credit card
      information is securely stored with our payment provider, displaying only the last four digits of your credit card
      numbers in Kala during the checkout process and in your account management page.</p>
    <p>It is also important for you as a user to protect against any unauthorized access to your account. When not using
      Kala, please be sure to sign out especially when using a public or shared device, and ensure that you create a
      strong password to better protect your account.</p>
    <p>Because we do not control the security of the Internet or other networks you use to access Kala or communicate
      with us, we can’t be, and are not responsible for, the security of information that you choose to
      communicate with Kala and the Site while it is being transmitted. In addition, Kala is not responsible for any
      data lost during transmission.</p>
    <h5 id="PRIVACY_POLICY_CHANGES">
      <strong>PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>We reserve the right to amend or update our Privacy and Data Use policy on occasion.</p>
    <p>When this does happen, Kala will alert you via email, text or other notification on Kala of any material changes
      to this policy before those changes become effective. That way, you have the control to determine whether you wish
      to continue using our services. Your acceptance of the changes may be through your continued use of Kala after the
      changes become effective.</p>
    <h5 id="CONTACT_KALA">
      <strong>CONTACT KALA</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact Kala’s support team by sending an email to
      privacy@mykala.com. Please be sure to indicate the nature of your question or concern.</p>
