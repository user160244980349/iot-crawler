Introduction</p> <p>Etekcity Corporation is an ecommerce retailer serving customers in areas such as health and fitness devices, home improvement devices, consumer electronics, smart household devices, outdoor recreational equipment, and beauty electronics products. Etekcity Corporation (referred to in this policy as “Etekcity,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to respecting your privacy. Therefore, Etekcity wrote this privacy policy to describe the types of personal information we may collect from you or that you may provide to us, how we use your personal information, how we protect it, when we may disclose it, and how we afford you rights regarding your personal information.</p> <p>This policy applies to information we collect:</p> <p>· On our website.</p> <p>· When we use phone, email, postal mail, text messages, or other forms of electronic communication to communicate with you.</p> <p>· When you access and post information on our social media sites.</p> <p>Etekcity has social media accounts on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. </p> <p><a href="/support/policy-EEA">If you are located in a member state of the European Economic Area(“EEA”), you may have different rights stated here.</a>  </p> <p>2. Application Partners’ Mobile Applications </p> <p>Etekcity works together and has a business partnership with various mobile application developers. Etekcity application partners include Vesync Corporation (“Vesync”). These application partners are affiliates of Etekcity, and as such, they collaborate with Etekcity concerning mobile applications to control and manage certain smart device products provided by Etekcity. In specific, Etekcity does not manage online accounts or the mobile applications allowing users to view and manage the personal information collected from Etekcity smart devices. Instead, Etekcity has arranged for mobile application partners such as Vesync to collect and maintain such personal information, and users can view and manage the personal information from their mobile devices using a mobile application from one of Etekcity’s application partners.</p> <p>This privacy policy does not govern applications of any application partners. Instead, application partners have their own privacy policy governing the use of its applications. Please refer to our application partners’ privacy policies if you have questions about how their mobile applications collect, use, disclose, protect, and manage your personal information. However, to the extent that a mobile application partner collects and maintains personal information collected from Etekcity smart devices as part of its arrangement with Etekcity, this privacy policy discloses Etekcity’s policies and practices relating to such personal information. Moreover, Etekcity requires its application partners to meet the standards in this privacy policy.</p> <p>3.

Currently, there is no standard governing what, if anything, a website operator should do when receiving a “do not track” signal. Therefore, Etekcity does not currently take action in response to a “do not track” browser setting. Etekcity will update this policy in response to developments regarding an industry standard concerning do not track settings.</p> <p>8.
