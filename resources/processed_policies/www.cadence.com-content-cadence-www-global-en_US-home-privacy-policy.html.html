    Use of Information
    <p>
        We process personal data where the processing is necessary to perform a contract between you and Cadence, to take steps at your request prior to entering into such contract, to comply with our legal obligations, or to exercise our legal rights. We also may process your information when the processing is otherwise in Cadence’s or a third party’s legitimate interests in accordance with applicable law. In particular, we and service providers working on our behalf, may use the information we collect for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>

            Providing you with the information that you request, or otherwise communicating with you;
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Generating and analyzing statistics about your use of the Sites; and
        </li>
        <li>
            Detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of the Sites, Cadence systems or assets.

    </ul>
    <p>
        We and service providers working on our behalf also may combine or aggregate any of the information we collect through the Sites or elsewhere for any of these purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are not obligated to provide us any personal information. However, if you do not, you may not be able to access certain product or service offerings. For example, certain areas of the Sites require user registration, which requires that you provide us with certain personal information.
    </p>
    Disclosure of Information
    <p>
        We may disclose each of the types of information described in the “Types of Information We Collect” to third parties, as described in this Privacy Policy, with other individuals or entities in situations such as the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When we have your permission;
        </li>
        <li>
            When you choose to make information public on the Sites, such as when you contribute a post to our Cadence Technology Forums;
        </li>
        <li>
            To service providers who work on our behalf and have agreed to use the information solely to provide the services requested by Cadence, including, but not limited to, service providers that process payments, provide support services, or provide shipping services;
        </li>
        <li>
            To service providers, advisors, and other third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, provided that any third party that acquires our company will assume the rights and obligations regarding your information as described in this Privacy Policy; or
        </li>
        <li>
            When we believe in good faith that such disclosure is to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to court orders or other legal process served on Cadence, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Cadence or users of the Sites; or (c) detect, prevent, or respond to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of the Sites.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In particular, depending on the products and/or services you use, the following are categories of information that are disclosed, and the steps we take to limit the manner in which your personal information is used:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We may provide contact information, to direct mail organizations, for the purposes of sending you information that you have agreed to receive. These companies may only use your information to perform functions on behalf of Cadence, as defined by the relevant service agreements.
        </li>
        <li>
            We may provide contact and employment information of registered users, to business partners, for identifying user interest in particular products and services. Business partners will only use such information as described in our agreement with them, and will only contact you with your permission.
        </li>
        <li>
            We may provide contact information, software usage, employment information, browsing history, and referral information, to business partners, so they may fulfil customer requests. In certain cases, we may contact users annually to confirm your desire to continue receiving information, and you may otherwise opt out as described further below.
        </li>
        <li>
            We may provide contact information, employment information, and license privileges of users of certain tools, to business customers, for purposes of identifying to whom software products should be distributed. Information is only shared with those customers to whom you have licensed their software product, and Cadence is under a contractual obligation to provide the list of users to those business partners, for use of the software.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Sale of Information
    </p>
    <p>
        In limited circumstances, we may disclose your information—with your express consent—in ways that may be considered a sale in certain jurisdictions, including as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cadence may receive payment from business partners that are authorized to sell Cadence products, should a sale result from our disclosure of your contact information to that partner, pursuant to the section above regarding “Disclosure of Information.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Under certain circumstances, our partners may also offer payment for provision of your contact information and interests (based on your browsing history), also pursuant to the section above regarding “Disclosure of Information.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Other than the limited instances identified above, Cadence does not sell your personal information to third parties.
    </p>
    Security of Your Information
    <p>
        We maintain reasonable physical, technical, and administrative procedures and practices to safeguard the information that we collect, and as is appropriate for the nature of the information. However, we cannot ensure the absolute security of your information, particularly of information you transmit to the Sites over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks. As a result, we suggest that you help us by protecting your passwords, not using the same password for different applications or sites on the Internet, and notifying us if you suspect that your credit card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission.
    </p>
    Children’s Privacy
    <p>
        The Sites are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect information from, anyone under 13 years of age. If you learn that your child provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at the contact information listed below.
    </p>
    Location of Your Information
    <p>
        Information covered by this Privacy Policy will be transferred to, stored at, and processed in the United States and other countries in which Cadence offices are located (as indicated on the
        <a href="http://www.cadence.com/">
            www.cadence.com
        </a>
        website) or where Cadence does business, which may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country. Before transferring your personal information, we will take steps to ensure that such data will be afforded the level of protection required under applicable data protection laws. For such data transfers, we may use the standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission and will make available a copy to you upon request. In addition, we may further transfer your information to our affiliates and service providers located in other countries, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.
    </p>
    Retention Period
    <p>
        We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. The criteria used to determine such retention periods include: (i) the length of time
    </p>
    <p>
        we have an ongoing relationship with you; (ii) whether there is a legal or business obligation to which we are subject; or (iii) whether a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, for example to maintain certain contractual or tax records.
