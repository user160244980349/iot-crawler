        Through health equipment, a smartphone, and cloud intelligence, RENPHO can provide you with unique health services. You can use the relevant features without having to register anywhere. But if you create a RENPHO account and share your information with us, we can provide you with better service.

The owner of this application, JOICOM CORPORATION (hereinafter referred to as "RENPHO"), is committed to protecting your online privacy. Please read the following statement to find out how your personal information will be treated when you are logged in, registered, and as a user on this App. This privacy statement may change from time to time. Please check it regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
        WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT:
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to render our services, we may collect any information you directly provide to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        This includes, but not limited to:
    </p>
    <p>
        (1) The information provided when you create or use your account or profile, such as your name, gender, telephone, date of birth, email address, personal description, and photograph.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION:
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect information in order to provide a better service to all users. The information collected is used to provide, maintain, protect and improve our services, and we use this information to provide you with customized content, such as the recommendation of health information best suited for you. Personal information will be used for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <p>
        (1) To complete your requirements for a particular service or product.
    </p>
    <p>
        (2) To provide you with specific services, products or information of RENPHO or third parties (such as RENPHO's partners) through various means (including but not limited to e-mail and SMS).
    </p>
    <p>
        (3) For the use of user data (such as the number of users, composition, interests, performance, etc.), so that we provide users with better services and products, or to a third party for a legitimate purpose to disclose such statistics. This class of statistics is the user group as a whole, rather than personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        HOW WE COLLECT DATA:
    </p>
    <p>
        The information we collect is divided into three categories:
    </p>
    <p>
        (1) The information you provided to us when you register a RENPHO account (the member information you submit, such as member nickname, birthday, height, weight, etc. belong to such data). The main purpose of collecting such data is to enable the system to find health information that is more relevant to you and your family’s specific situation and to analyze your health tendencies for you and your family, giving you more fulfilling user experience. We will always ensure that the required information is kept as minimal as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        (2) We also get information when you use the service. We collect information about the services you use and how you use them, including devices, time, location, IP addresses, unique anonymous identifiers, and so on. The purpose of collecting such information is to allow us to better understand the trends of the entire user group such as regional distribution, the time of use, etc. It allows us to have better insight to optimize the system and provide users with a better overall experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        (3) For subject to the GDPR (European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation), we ask for your explicit consent to process the health data or another special category of personal data. We obtain this consent separately when you take actions leading to our obtaining the data such as when you pair your device to your account and sync with other fitness apps. You can use your account settings and other tools to withdraw your consent at any time, for example, stopping the use of a feature, removing the access to a third-party service, or deleting your data and your account.
    </p>
