        How do our Products work and how do they process your personal data?
    </h2>
    <p>
        All Products manufactured by Withings are connected objects that require the use of an iOS or Android device. The creation of a Withings account via a device is therefore a prerequisite for the installation of our Products.
    </p>
    <p>

Some features are only accessible through the connection between your Product and the application. The personal data collected by the Products is stored and transmitted to our servers on your Withings account when you synchronize your Product with our mobile application, or when you connect your Product to your Wifi network. This synchronization on our servers
        <strong>
            located in France

        is necessary in order to allow:
    </p>

        <li>
            updating the software of our Products to fix bugs, add new features or apply changes made necessary by legal and regulatory evolutions in the field of data;

        <li>
            the backup of your data: in the event of loss or theft of an iOS or Android device on which our application is installed, you will be able to recover all your data;
        </li>
        <li>
            the taking of measurements without being in the vicinity of your iOS or Android device on which our application is installed;
        </li>
