        CalOPPA requires commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers, to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.

        The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“
        <strong>
            CCPA
        </strong>
        ”) permits users who are California residents to request to exercise certain rights. If you are a California resident, the CCPA grants you the right to request certain information about our practices with respect to your Personal Information. In particular, you can request to receive information on the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The categories and specific pieces of your Personal Information that we have collected.
        </li>
        <li>
            The categories of sources from which we collected your Personal Information.
        </li>
        <li>
            The business or commercial purposes for which we collected your Personal Information

            The categories of third parties with which we shared your Personal Information.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can be rest assured that we do not sell your Personal Information. If you choose to exercise your rights, we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of our Services, unless those differences are related to the provision of your Personal Information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that you must verify your identity and request before further action is taken. As a part of this process, government identification may be required. Moreover, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
        We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide, will only cover the 12 month period preceding your verifiable request's receipt. If, for some reason, we cannot reply within such time frame, our response will include an explanation for our inability to comply. If you wish to exercise your CCPA rights, please contact us at:

            Deny you goods or services.
