    <h3>
        Does Keen Home Track My Activity Across Other Websites?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Like many websites, Keen Home uses select advertising Partners to “retarget” advertisements. Retargeting occurs when a select advertising Partner places a persistent cookie on your computer or mobile device to track your activities across other websites, and to improve the relevance of the advertisements you receive across the websites you visit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, when you visit our website, Keen Home automatically collects the name of the website you came from (called the “referring page”), and the name of the website you visited immediately after ours (called the “exit page”). This information is used exclusively to improve your experience on Keen Home’s website, and to increase the relevance of the advertisements you receive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because Keen Home use persistent cookies, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option on your browser may not stop the cookies we use from collecting information about other websites you have visited. However, you may prevent our advertising Partners from tracking your activities by adjusting the settings in your browser so it rejects cookies or so it is set to “Do Not Track.” Please remember, Keen Home has no means of confirming or controlling whether its advertising Partners honor the “Do Not Track” browser settings.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What If I Follow A Link To A Third-Party Website?

An advertiser or third-party may receive the information you enter into a form or survey contained in an advertisement. Any personal information you enter is provided directly to that third-party and is subject to that third-party's privacy policy.
    </p>
    <h3>
