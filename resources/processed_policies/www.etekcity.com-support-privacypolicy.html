        1. Introduction
    </p>
    <p>
        Etekcity Corporation is an ecommerce retailer serving customers in areas such as health and fitness devices, home improvement devices, consumer electronics, smart household devices, outdoor recreational equipment, and beauty electronics products. Etekcity Corporation (referred to in this policy as “Etekcity,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to respecting your privacy. Therefore, Etekcity wrote this privacy policy to describe the types of personal information we may collect from you or that you may provide to us, how we use your personal information, how we protect it, when we may disclose it, and how we afford you rights regarding your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        This policy applies to information we collect:
    </p>
    <p>
        · On our website.
    </p>
    <p>
        · When we use phone, email, postal mail, text messages, or other forms of electronic communication to communicate with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        · When you access and post information on our social media sites.

    </p>
    <p>
        2. Application Partners’ Mobile Applications
    </p>
    <p>
        Etekcity works together and has a business partnership with various mobile application developers. Etekcity application partners include Vesync Corporation (“Vesync”). These application partners are affiliates of Etekcity, and as such, they collaborate with Etekcity concerning mobile applications to control and manage certain smart device products provided by Etekcity. In specific, Etekcity does not manage online accounts or the mobile applications allowing users to view and manage the personal information collected from Etekcity smart devices. Instead, Etekcity has arranged for mobile application partners such as Vesync to collect and maintain such personal information, and users can view and manage the personal information from their mobile devices using a mobile application from one of Etekcity’s application partners.
    </p>
    <p>
        This privacy policy does not govern applications of any application partners. Instead, application partners have their own privacy policy governing the use of its applications. Please refer to our application partners’ privacy policies if you have questions about how their mobile applications collect, use, disclose, protect, and manage your personal information. However, to the extent that a mobile application partner collects and maintains personal information collected from Etekcity smart devices as part of its arrangement with Etekcity, this privacy policy discloses Etekcity’s policies and practices relating to such personal information. Moreover, Etekcity requires its application partners to meet the standards in this privacy policy.

        3. Use by Children

        Although we market and sell our electronic products to adults, we recognize that family and household members of purchasers using our products may be children. Online accounts maintained by an application partner used by adult purchasers of our products to review personal information collected via these products may include personal information of purchasers’ family and household members who are children. The Etekcity products and services covered by this Section 3.2 are those associated with an application partner online account that collects a child’s name and other personal information in connection with the use of the product. Users access their online accounts using an application partner’s mobile application.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section describes the following aspects of personal information collected from children in connection with the use of products covered by this section:

    </p>
    <p>
        Etekcity’s smart devices may collect personal information, such as weight, blood, pressure, and fitness information, when children use them. Application partner online accounts may include a child’s name associated with personal information collected by smart devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.2.2. How Etekcity and its Application Partners Collect Personal Information from Children
    </p>
    <p>
        Etekcity smart devices that collect personal information use sensors to collect the information. When children are using these smart devices, an application partner receives, stores, and maintains their personal information. Users may view and manage the collected personal information using an application partner’s online account accessed via an application partner’s mobile application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Application partners may also collect personal information about children (such as the child’s name) when parents or guardians provide the information to an application partner using their online accounts accessed via an application partner’s mobile application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application partner will obtain verifiable consent before collecting personal information about children. For instance, when a parent or guardian adds a child to an online account, the parent or guardian must consent to the collection of personal information about the child.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.2.3. Uses of Personal Information Collected from Children
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        3.2.4. Third Party Disclosure, Sharing, and Maintenance
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        · Parents and guardians are entitled to delete personal information about a child as described in Section 3.2.7.

        If you revoke permission to collect a child’s personal information or delete a child’s personal information, your child will not be able to use the functionality of our smart devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please keep in mind that in unusual circumstances we may have a legal right or obligation to preserve a child’s personal information as it currently exists. If we do not amend or delete personal information about your child upon your request, we will communicate with you concerning the reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.2.7. How Parents and Guardians Can Exercise Their Rights.
    </p>
    <p>

        7.2.Notice to California Residents Regarding “Do Not Track” Settings
    </p>
    <p>
        Under California law, online service providers must say in their privacy policies how they respond to “do not track” settings that users can set in their browser software. Currently, there is no standard governing what, if anything, a website operator should do when receiving a “do not track” signal. Therefore, Etekcity does not currently take action in response to a “do not track” browser setting. Etekcity will update this policy in response to developments regarding an industry standard concerning do not track settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        8. How We Secure Personal Information
    </p>
    <p>
        Etekcity has an information security program to implement reasonable and appropriate industry-standard security controls to protect personal information in its possession. Etekcity also requires application partners and their service providers to implement controls that are at least as stringent as the ones Etekcity itself uses, consistent with this policy. Etekcity’s administrative, physical, and technical safeguards:
    </p>
    <p>
        · Provide assurances of the integrity and confidentiality of personal information covered by this policy;
    </p>
    <p>
        · Protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of personal information, and unauthorized uses or disclosures of such personal information; and
    </p>
    <p>
        · Facilitate compliance with legal frameworks of requirements under applicable data protection laws.
    </p>
    <p>
        One example of a security safeguard we use is encryption. Specifically, our electronic commerce website uses encrypted communications when it obtains your personal information and our payment service receives your payment information to complete orders and obtain payment for products you purchase using our website.
    </p>
    <p>
        9. Exercising Your Rights
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        9.2.Identity Verification
    </p>
    <p>
        Etekcity has an obligation to verify the identity of any individual or representative seeking to exercise rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
    </p>
    <p>
        For California residents with a password-protected account on our website, we can verify your identity by having you access your account and complete a web form to submit a request for your rights or confirm that you made a request.
    </p>
    <p>
        For California residents that do not have an account on our website:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We will verify your identity in response to a request to exercise your individual rights by requiring that you to provide two pieces of information that we already have on file with you, which may include:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Items of contact information, or
            </li>
            <li>
                Content of communications you sent to us.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            In addition, in the case of a request for specific pieces of personal information, we will ask for an additional piece of information that we may have in addition to the two pieces requested above, together with a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the requestor is the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request or an authorized agent acting on behalf of that consumer.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        An authorized agent seeking to exercise rights on behalf of an individual California resident must prove the agent’s authority either by providing a power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4121 to 4130 or by:
    </p>
    <p>
        · Providing a copy of a writing signed by the resident giving the agent permission to act on the resident’s behalf;
    </p>
    <p>
        · Verification of the authorized agent’s own identity under the procedures in this section; and/or
    </p>
    <p>
        · Communicating with the California resident directly to confirm the status of the agent as being authorized to act on behalf of the resident.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will not provide or delete information as requested if we are unable to verify the identity of the requestor as required above, if an agent cannot prove authority to act on behalf of an individual, or we have reason to believe that the request is fraudulent. We may ask for additional verification if we suspect fraud, such as a copy of an identification credential from the requestor. We will use any such additional information strictly for identity verification purposes, and it will be deleted following the completion of the verification process. We may, however, retain any information needed to comply with the CCPA or other applicable law.
    </p>
