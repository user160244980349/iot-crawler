            <ul>
                <li>We may share personal data about you with other members of our group of companies so we can provide the best service across our group. They are bound to keep your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>

            Please be noted that our Privacy Policy does not apply to the products or services offered by any third party. Our Website has incorporated some third parties’ products or services, such as YouTube, and your personal data may also be collected when you use these products or services. For this reason, we strongly suggest that you take your time to carefully read the third party’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for and cannot control how third parties use personal data which they collect from you.<br>
            <strong>4. How long and where we keep your personal data</strong><br>

            For clarity, your personal data will be deleted or anonymized when it is no longer needed for its originally stated processing purposes or for any additional compatible purpose for which we may lawfully further process such data.<br>
            <strong>Legal requirements</strong><br>

We may also transfer your personal data to third-party service providers and business partners and your data may therefore be transmitted to other countries or regions. Those countries may not have equivalent data protection laws to those applicable in the EU or the People of China. We do, however, ensure an adequate data protection level by agreements with these third-party service providers and by adopting other necessary arrangements, both technical and organizational.<br>
