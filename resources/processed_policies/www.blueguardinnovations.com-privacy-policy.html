    </h2>
    <p>
        Our approach to responsible information handling is founded on the basis of the Fair Information Practices, the cornerstone of which is providing notice of our information practices and other privacy aspects in order to allow individuals to make informed decisions regarding personally identifiable information. When you visit our websites or apps, information may be requested in order for you to completely participate in our online offerings and services. When we collect information from you, we let you know what is being collected, how it is collected, for what purpose(s) it is collected, and to whom it may be disclosed.

    <h2>
        Use of Cookies
    </h2>
    <p>
        To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, Blue Guard Innovations, LLC collects aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer’s machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology, or action tags, assist in delivering the cookie. This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a bluebgi.com web page. It is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about the bluebgi.com web site usage. We also may use Google Sites Stats tracking technology to view visited pages within our website to enhance user experience. We do not share tracking information outside of Blue Guard Innovations, LLC.

When you provide personally identifiable information to us that may be used for secondary purposes (i.e., uses not related to the purpose for which the information was collected), we give you the opportunity to opt-out of such uses.
