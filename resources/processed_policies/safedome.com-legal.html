    Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms.
    <p>
        1. What are Cookies?
    </p>
    <p>
        We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies:
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.

    </p>
    <p>
        3. Disabling Cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function, such as the shopping cart.
