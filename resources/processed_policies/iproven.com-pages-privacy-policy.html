    <br/>
    Privacy and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    <br/>
    <p>
        As we are a company based in the European Union, we need to comply to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The legal grounds for processing Personal Data under the GDPR described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may process your Personal Data based on several legal grounds. One of the grounds is because we need to perform a contract with you. This is for example the case when we need to comply with the agreements we made together according to the
        <a href="https://iproven.com/pages/terms-of-use">
            https://iproven.com/pages/terms-of-use
        </a>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        Another legal basis is your given permission. When we ask you for example if we may send you a newsletter, you are asked for your permission to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some cases, however, we need to collect and save your personal data because this is required by law. For instance, when it is needed to process and store your data for tax liabilities.
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Information Collection and Use
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you. These different types of data consist of personal data, usage data and tracking and cookies data. We have shortly explained where the different types of data exist off.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Personal Data
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:

        <li>
            Email address
        </li>
        <li>
            First name and last name

            Address, State, Province, ZIP/Postal code, City

        <li>
            Bank information

        Most of the times we need this information to comply with the agreements ensuing from the Terms of Use or other agreements we made.
    </p>
    Usage Data
    <p>
        We may also collect information how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data. We simply need this information to improve the Service.
    </p>
    Tracking &amp; Cookies Data
    <p>
        We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies are files with small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our Service.

    </p>
    <p>
        If not mentioned already, iProven will use the Personal Data for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To provide and maintain the Service
        </li>
        <li>
            To notify you about changes to our Service
        </li>
        <li>
            To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Service when you choose to do so
        </li>
        <li>
            To provide customer care and support
        </li>
        <li>
            To provide analysis or valuable information so that we can improve the Service
        </li>
        <li>
            To monitor the usage of the Service
        </li>
        <li>
            To detect, prevent and address technical issues
        </li>
        <li>
            Profiling: We use profiling when offering our Services. Profiling is automated processing of data to analyze or to make predictions about individuals. The way we use profiling is for instance to provide you the Service that suits you the best based on your activities on iProven.com.
            <br/>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Transfer of Data
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are located outside the Netherlands and choose to provide information to us, please note that we may transfer the data, including Personal Data, to the Netherlands and process it there if this is required for the purpose we need the Personal Data for.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        iProven will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organisation or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.
        <br/>
        One of the ways we can realize this is to close ‘processor agreements’ with the relevant parties, so we are sure they handle your data with the same care as we do.
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Security of Data
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The security of your data is important to us. Therefore, we took the necessary steps to make sure your Personal Data is safe and will be protected against losses and/or leaks of this information. Nevertheless, we have to inform you that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            How long does iProven keep your information?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We will store your personal data as long as is necessary for the purposes named in this Privacy Policy. This is for example the case to provide and maintain our Services. Obviously, we need your account information otherwise we simply don’t know who you are. We also need to keep this data to make sure you can log in every time you want.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are not logged in to your account for five (5) years we will delete your data or anonymise it in case, we still need the data to meet for example our legal obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some cases, we also need to keep your data because this is required by law. For personal data that is related to taxes for example, we have to keep your data for a minimum seven (7) years. Also, in this case, we will delete your data, or anonymize it in case we still need the data to meet for example our legal obligations.
        <br/>

        <strong>
            Service Providers
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
    </p>
    <p>
        These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

            Google Analytics
            <br/>
            Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service.

            <br/>
            You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.
