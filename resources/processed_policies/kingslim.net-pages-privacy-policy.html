  SECURITY
 </strong>
 Personal information provided on the website and online credit card transactions are transmitted through a secure server. We are committed to handling your personal information with high standards of information security.

Our website uses encryption technology, like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport.

 <strong>
  Direct Mail or Telephone Marketing
 </strong>
 If you shop at the kingslim.net or Private Sales stores and wish to be removed from the list of customers that receive direct mail or telemarketing calls, please either write to kingslim.net Customer Care. If you choose to write to us, please include your name, address, and credit card account number (if you have one), and state one of the following:
 <p>
  "NO MAIL OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive offers by mail);
 </p>

  "NO PHONE OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive offers by phone); or
 </p>
 <p>
  "NO PHONE OR MAIL OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive either).

We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.
 <strong>
  COOKIES, WEB BEACONS, AND HOW WE USE THEM
 </strong>
 A "cookie" is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer or mobile device [hard drive]. It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database. A "web beacon" or "pixel tag" or "clear gif" is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer or mobile device to a website.  We use cookies and web beacons to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the website as well as to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the website you visited immediately before clicking to the kingslim.net. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our website will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. We may also use web beacons, and other technologies, to help track whether our communications are reaching you, to measure their effectiveness, or to collect certain non-personal information about your computer, device, or browser in order to allow us to better design future communications to you.  We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and web beacons and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services, or data management. We call them our Customer Care Partners. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners.
 <strong>
  ONLINE ACCOUNT REGISTRATION

If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to LOG OUT at the conclusion of your session. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.
 <strong>
  EMAILS
 </strong>
 You will receive promotional emails from us only if you have asked to receive them. If you do not want to receive email from kingslim.net or its affiliates you can click on the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email communication sent by us.
