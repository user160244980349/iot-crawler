    <h3>
        Privacy Policy
    </h3>
    When you leave any personal information on our web site, either by visiting the "Registration" page or by placing an order, you can be assured that our company is the only one who will use it. We do not rent, sell, or otherwise distribute any information from our customer database, including e-mail addresses.
    <br/>
    Your e-mail address, if you provide one, is stored in your customer record in our database. You can enter more than one e-mail address by separating them with a ";" character. If you leave the e-mail address blank, or erase it later (from the Registration page), you can be assured that you will not receive any more e-mail from us. If you provide a valid e-mail address, it will always be used to confirm any order you place and to communicate with you, if necessary, about your order.
    <br/>
    When you place an order with Cables Direct Online, we'll set you up to receive our newsletter. It's our way of keeping you in the loop on Cables Direct Online news, special deals, new products, and insider looks at our product development projects.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        Address
    </h3>
    We will not rent, sell, or otherwise distribute your physical or billing address to anyone.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        Security
    </h3>
    Your security is a priority at Cables Direct Online. To provide credit card security and keep your personal information safe, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, the most widely used data encryption coding system for secure e-commerce transactions. All of your information is encrypted (scrambled) prior to being sent over the Internet to our system.
    <br/>
    To protect your information once we receive it, we place it on systems behind secure firewalls, which are communication-management computers designed to keep information safe and inaccessible to other Internet users. If your browser doesn't accept the SSL technology, transactions will not be permitted.
    <br/>
    To confirm that your connection is secure, look for a locked padlock icon or solid key icon at the bottom of your browser window. The letters "https" (rather than "http") located in the URL address window at the top of your browser also indicate that you are using a secure browser.
    <h3>
        Credit Card Information
    </h3>
    To ensure your safety online, we maintain strict PCI compliance and do not store credit card numbers on our servers. We offer our customers the option of "storing" their cards with us for future use. However, the only two pieces of information we store are 1) the last 4 digits of your card and 2) a special token that allows us to reference your card for future transactions with the issuing bank.
    <br/>
    This allows you to avoid the hassle of repeatedly typing in credit card information while eliminating the risk of identity theft.
