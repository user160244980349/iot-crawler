    <h2>
        What is the General Data Protection Regulation?
    </h2>
    <p>
        GDPR is a European Union law intended to strengthen and unify data protection rules and rights for the benefit of EU citizens. GDRP applies to EU organizations and to non-EU organizations (of any size) that provide goods and services to the EU or that utilize tracking technologies (like cookies or tracking pixels) to monitor EU user’s behavior.
    </p>
    <h2>
        1. Personal Information – What we collect and why
    </h2>
    <p>
        We offer certain site features, services, applications, and tools that are available only through the use of the following tracking technologies. You are always free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your browser, installed application, or device so permits. However, if you decline cookies or other similar technologies, you may not be able to take advantage of certain site features, services, applications, or tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally, these technologies allow our sites, services, applications, and tools to store relevant information in your browser or device and later read that information in order to identify you to our servers or internal systems. Where applicable, we protect our cookies and other similar technologies to help ensure that only we and/or our authorized service providers can interpret them by assigning them a unique identifier that is designed for interpretation only by us.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website collects and uses personal information for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <h3>
        1.1. Google Analytics
    </h3>
    <p>
        Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their journey through the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although GA records data such as your geographical location, device, internet browser and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us. GA also records your computer’s IP address which could be used to personally identify you but Google do not grant us access to this. We consider Google to be a third party data processor (see section 2 below).
    </p>
    <p>
        GA makes use of cookies, details of which can be found on Google’s developer guides. FYI our website uses the analytics.js implementation of GA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Disabling cookies on your internet browser will stop GA from tracking any part of your visit to pages within this website.
    </p>
    <h3>
        1.2. Skyfish
    </h3>
    <p>
        To support the OJ Login service the site uses Skyfish. The Skyfish solution enables the site to share information that is relevant to specific users, only. To be a user of the OJ Login service, we register your email as well as first and last name in the Skyfish database. This information is used to generate user profiles and give access to restricted content. The Skyfish database generates a password, which the database forwards to the registered email. The password is unknown to OJ.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your personal data will remain within the Skyfish database until you specifically request removal from the OJ Login Service. You can do this by sending an email to website@ojelectronics.com. Write “Removal from OJ Customer Login” in the subject line. When requesting removal, please send your email to us using the email account that is subscribed to the Skyfish solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Skyfish makes use of cookies, details of which can be found on Skyfish’s website. Skyfish cookies are “persistent cookies”.
    </p>
    <h3>
        1.3. Contact and support forms
    </h3>
    <p>

        The information contained in the email will automatically be transferred onwards to our CRM system. From there, the data will be attached to any existing account with a similar email address or else be created as a new contact. The purpose is to fulfill your request.
    </p>
    <h3>
        1.4. Email newsletter
    </h3>
    <p>
        If you choose to join our email newsletter, the email address that you submit to us will be forwarded to our CRM system. Your email will be stored in our backend database and in our CRM system.

When requesting removal via email, please send your email to us using the email account that is subscribed to the mailing list.
