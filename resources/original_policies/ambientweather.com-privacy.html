Additionally, non-personal information, such as performance of a Service, is collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected by us as well as third parties.</p>
<p>If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. We may also retain any messages you send through our Services and you may also provide us information in user content you post to a Service.</p>
<p>We may offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on or through a Service. "Public activities" are any actions you take on or through a Service that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by us for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected and used by other users of these areas. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in the course of your public activities and we have no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your public activities or submissions.</p>
<p>Public activities may be included in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not us.</p>
<p>When you share or recommend links to content on a third-party platform (such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter), that action and any information you share will be covered by their privacy policy.</p>

<p>We may partner with other parties to provide specific services. When you sign up for these services, we will share your name or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to a Service, such as user content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy or website customization settings. If you remove information that you posted to the Site, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or if other users have copied or saved that information.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce this policy, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the Service, our users or others.</p>

<h2>How We Protect Information</h2>
<p>We take several measures to safeguard the collection, transmission and storage of the data we collect. Although we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content. No system is 100% secure. The Services use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information and credit card numbers. The Services are registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can confirm NK’s identity before any personally identifiable information is sent. In addition, NK’s secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall technology.</p>
<p>To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorized access to your private information, you should be aware of the security features available to you through your browser. You should use a security-enabled browser to submit your credit card information and other personal information at the Services. Please note that if you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data intercepted.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from us, at all times.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>While NK will always work hard to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. We care about the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that your information on the service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third-party providers, such as social networks. We are not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.</p>

<h2>Compromise of Personal Information</h2>
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>Your Choices About Your Information</h2>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through our Services, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can review and correct the information about you that we keep on file. Some of this can be accomplished directly through your Account Settings. Otherwise, feel free to contact us directly at <a href="mailto:privacy@nkhome.com">privacy@nkhome.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Site accounts. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on the Site. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@nkhome.com">privacy@nkhome.com</a>.</p>

<h2>International Transfers</h2>
<p>NK is headquartered in the United States. The information you submit to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Services may be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to the United States or to another country so that we may provide you the Services. U.S. law and the laws of other countries where we may store and process your information may offer different levels of protection for information than may be available in your country. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of your information.</p>

<h2>EU Members' Rights</h2>
<p>If you are habitually located in the European Union, you have the right to access, rectify or erase your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited circumstances. You may access your information by logging into your account. For more information, or to request that we delete or erase your information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@nkhome.com">privacy@nkhome.com</a>. We will generally respond to your request within 5-7 business days.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Services, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>

<h2>Surveys and Contests</h2>
<p>From time-to-time our Services may request information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Services.</p>

<h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>Under the California "Shine the Light" law, California residents may opt-out of our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, you may choose to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request via post or e-mail to:</p>

<a href="mailto:privacy@nkhome.com">privacy@nkhome.com</a></p>
<p>It is important to note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures made for non-marketing purposes.</p>

<h2>Notification Procedures</h2>
<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Site, as determined by us in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on the Services to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
