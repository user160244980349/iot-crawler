    </h3>
    <p>
        We obtain your personal data from you in a variety of ways. This includes:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            When You Supply Us Your Personal Data.
        </strong>
        We receive any personal data including Identifiers (e.g., name, e-mail address, telephone number, fax, job function/title, company/organization name), Demographic Data (e.g., your country, industry), Commercial Information (e.g., current customer status, product interests), Feedback, and Other Data that you choose to provide us through our Site, over the phone, or through other means. This includes information provided when you fill out forms on our Site or sign up for newsletters and other types of information material.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            When You Sign Up for Reminders.
        </strong>
        The Site allows you to sign up for e-mail reminders regarding such things as when it is time to check your tire pressure, to have your tires rotated, or for routine tire maintenance. In order to send you these reminders, you will need to provide us with some of your personal data, including your Identifiers (e.g., name and e-mail address and zip code) and Tire and Vehicle Details, including your car's make, type, year, current brand tires, last time tires were rotated and miles driven per month. We will use the information you provide to keep track of your car's tire rotation needs, to send you tire reminders, and to identify the nearest dealer location to you (unless you provided us with this information in connection with a tire warranty or recall). This information will not be shared with third parties. We may use it as aggregate information to keep track of certain trends.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you later decide that you no longer wish to receive these e-mail reminders, you may follow the instructions in the last e-mail reminder you received to remove yourself from these notifications, or you may submit a request to unsubscribe via our
        <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/9a5b96f7-7433-4ab6-a66f-9802cf641944/126e1737-0544-4062-9480-31058b634eeb">

    To help you find a dealer or select a Cooper® tire, we ask where you live or your car make or model to find a dealer or select a tire best for your car. We may also ask you for your car’s license plate number and state; the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN); or your car’s year, make, model, and trim.
    <br/>
    We may share this information with the selected dealer to better assist you with your prospective tire purchase. We store your information such as the location you enter for the dealer locator and the year, make, and model of a car.
    <br/>
    <strong>
        For Tire Recalls.

When you contact us, we may with your consent (as may be required) use your Feedback to share your testimonials about our products with our Cooper® dealers and other retailers in order to promote Cooper’s products, improve Cooper’s products, to conduct internal market research or to facilitate the resolution of a dispute between you and a dealer.

    <br/>
    <strong>

            However, you will be given a choice to "opt out" of being contacted in this way.
        </strong>

    </p>

We use this information to track consumer trends and demographic information, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
    </p>
    <strong>

    </strong>
    We may use your personal data for any other purpose for which you consent.

    </h2>
    Cooper® maintains technical and organizational safeguards to ensure an appropriate level of security and confidentiality for your personal data, in accordance with relevant policies and applicable legislation. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal data, Cooper® cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided by our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.
    <strong>
        To the extent permitted by law, Cooper® will not be liable for disclosures of your personal data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties.
    </strong>
    However, once we receive your transmission, we do our best to ensure its security on our systems by making reasonable efforts to protect the information.
    <br/>
    <strong>
        Dealer Numbers:
    </strong>
    Dealers are assigned Dealer Numbers when they become a registered Cooper® dealer. This number gives Dealers access to certain parts of the Site; however, Dealers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their Dealer Numbers. Therefore, we recommend that Dealers do not divulge their Dealer Number to anyone unaffiliated with them. Cooper® will never ask you for your Dealer Number in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to close your browser window when you have finished using this Site. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal data and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.

                    Internal Use: to use your personal data, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information (i.e. to improve our services).

    <h3>
        How to Exercise Your Rights
    </h3>
    To make any such request, you or your authorized agent may:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Call us at 1-833-729-0090 (toll free).
        </li>
        <li>
            Submit the request using our
            <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/9a5b96f7-7433-4ab6-a66f-9802cf641944/126e1737-0544-4062-9480-31058b634eeb">
                Request Form
            </a>
            on our Site.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Before we can fulfill your request, we need to verify your identity or your agent’s authority to make the request and confirm the personal data relates to you.
    <br/>
    Only you or your authorized agent acting on your behalf have the ability to make a request related to your personal data. If you personally make the request, Cooper® will require you to provide us with certain information in order to verify that you are the person about whom we have information.
    <br/>
    If you have an authorized agent who makes the request, you must submit either (i) proof of power of attorney or (ii) a written and signed declaration or affidavit demonstrating that your agent has the authority to act on your behalf, along with information from you to verify your identity through the ordinary verification process.
    <br/>
    Please note that if we cannot verify your identity, we are not obligated to fulfill your request.
    <br/>
    Once we have verified your identity, we will fulfill your request.
    <br/>
    If you have submitted a request to know, we may give you specific pieces of personal data we collected about you and provide you with an individualized response about how we have collected, used, and disclosed your personal information. For the specific pieces of personal data, we will provide such information electronically (or, if you are unable to receive such information electronically, by mail at your request) in a readily useable format that allows you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
    <h3>
        Notice of the Right to Opt Out of Sale
    </h3>
    You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information, as defined in the CCPA. The term “sale” is defined broadly under the California Consumer Privacy Act. Cooper® discloses some personal information to third parties that may constitute a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA.
    <br/>
    To the extent that “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include interest-based advertising or other data uses described in the “Personal Data We Collect Automatically Using Tracking Technologies” Section
    <a href="#1.2">
        1.2
    </a>
    above, we will comply with applicable law as to those activities
    <br/>
    To stop receiving interest-based advertising and other similar uses, you can adjust your privacy settings, or the general privacy settings link located at the footer of our homepage and most pages of the website.
