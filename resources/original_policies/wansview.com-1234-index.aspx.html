When you register for an Account you may be asked to provide some personally identifiable information, such as your email address, phone number, camera SN code and a username and password that you select.

When you provide credentials for a third-party site or service, we may use those credentials to obtain information about you from that third party. See Section 1.4 (Information from Other Sources) and 3.5 (Social Sites) for more information. When you register an Account and log in to a&nbsp;Wansview&nbsp;Services you must provide your current, complete, and accurate information.

When you associate a product with your Account you will need to provide Wi-Fi network information (this may include username and password) to&nbsp;Wansview&nbsp;mobile applications (“Wansview&nbsp;App” or “Wansview&nbsp;Apps”). The&nbsp;Wansview&nbsp;App will send the information to the product by using the QR code and the product will use the information to connect to the Wi-Fi network. Once a product is associated with your Account it will remain associated until you unbind the product from your Account or terminate your Account. The Wi-Fi network user name and password may be saved in your&nbsp;Wansview&nbsp;Apps or your&nbsp;Wansview&nbsp;products but it will not be sent to&nbsp;Wansview&nbsp;services or&nbsp;Wansview.</span></span>

When encountering unreliable point-to-point network conditions, the&nbsp;Wansview&nbsp;camera product may opt to relay videos through our servers to the mobile app to achieve optimal viewing experience. In each scenario, both videos and the transmission channel are securely encrypted. The role of our servers is only to act as a relay agent, and they do not store video content transmitted to or through them in connection with our provision of&nbsp;WansviewServices.</span></span>

Turning this feature OFF will NOT affect the normal operations of&nbsp;WansviewCam and its&nbsp;Wansview&nbsp;App. If the user chooses to turn on this feature, a short video up to 10 seconds long and one or more pictures are encrypted individually and transferred to and stored on our servers when the camera has detected activity, provided that you have activated the <span style="font-family:微软雅黑">“activity alerts” functionality within the&nbsp;Wansview&nbsp;App for&nbsp;Wansview&nbsp;camera product. If you don’t delete the videos stored on our servers, they shall be automatically deleted on a regular basis (typically seven days). However, we cannot ensure that residual copies do not survive elsewhere (e.g., in a cache or backup).</span></span></span>
