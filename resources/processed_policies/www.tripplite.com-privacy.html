        We maintain reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction.

            Other Issues.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            (i) What is the legal basis of processing?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for collecting and processing Personal Data. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process Personal Data, including: (i) as necessary to perform a transaction (such as when we respond to your requests or register a new product); (ii) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as for recordkeeping for consumer protection or tax purposes); (iii) consent (such as for direct marketing or certain cookies); and (iv) necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business generally, including maintaining the safety and security of the Site). With respect to legitimate interests, we typically collect and process limited Personal Data about partner and distributor contacts and other individuals acting in their business capacities, as part of our overall effort to reduce the privacy impact on individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            (ii) What are the consequences of not providing Personal Data?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        You are not required to provide all Personal Data identified in this Privacy Policy to use our Site or to interact with us offline, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide certain Personal Data. If you do not provide certain Personal Data, we may not be able to respond to your requests, register your new product, or provide you with marketing that we believe you would find valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            (iii) Do we engage in automated decision-making without human intervention?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            (iv) Does the Site honor do not track ("DNT") signals sent via browsers?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since there is not a standard in the marketplace, we currently do not respond to DNT signals at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            (v) How long do we retain Personal Data?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We typically retain Personal Data related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing communications from us, and upon request, we will securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law. For Personal Data that we collect and process for other purposes, as described above, we typically retain such Personal Data for no longer than the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, and as otherwise needed to address tax, corporate, consumer protection, compliance, litigation, and other legal rights and obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            (vi) Are third party websites governed by this Privacy Policy?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        This Site contains links and references to other websites administered by unaffiliated third parties, including resellers and distributors of Tripp Lite products and social media networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such third party websites. When you click a link to visit a third party website, you will be subject to that website's privacy practices. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy and security practices of any linked third party websites before providing any Personal Data on those websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            (vii) How will we handle any changes to this Privacy Policy?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time-to-time as our services and privacy practices change, or as required by law. The effective date of our Privacy Policy is posted below, and we encourage you to visit our Site periodically to stay informed about our privacy practices. We will post the updated version of the Privacy Policy on our Site, and ask for your consent to the changes if legally required.
