          <p>When you initiate contact with METUS regarding an issue or problem, any personal information you provide is voluntary.

In addition, we may store and process personal information and share it with our worldwide subsidiaries and affiliates to better understand your needs and improve our relationship with you. METUS does not use or disclose information gathered from individual visits to the Sites or information you provide to METUS to any third parties with the intention to sell, rent or otherwise market your personal information.

          <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), as well as various other state laws, prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the collection, use, and/or disclosure of personal information from and about children on the Internet. METUS does not knowingly collect information from children nor does it target its Site or mobile applications to children less than 13 years of age. Children without the consent of their parent or guardian should not submit personal Information to the Site. If we discover that we have collected the personal information of a child, as defined by law, we will take immediate steps to handle that information in accordance with the law. Any minor under 18 years of age may also remove, or request and obtain removal of, online content that is collected and stored when such information is submitted by the user by directly contacting the Webmaster. METUS encourages all parents or guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their personal information while using the Internet.</p>

          <h3>Choices In Selecting Privacy Preferences</h3>
          <p>You may, at your discretion, subscribe to and receive information related to METUS products and services, including general METUS communications by postal mail, email, telephone, or mobile device. You also have the right to make or change these preferences at any time. This option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering order completion, contracts, support, product safety warnings, or other administrative and transactional notices where the primary purpose of these communications is not promotional in nature.</p>

          <h3>Access To And Accuracy Of Your Information</h3>
          <p>METUS wants to ensure that it accurately records your personal information. You have the right to request the disclosure of your personal information in our possession and mandate revisions when necessary. METUS offers you ways to update and/or to delete incorrect information, barring the need to retain it for legitimate business or legal purposes. In order to update your personal information, METUS may, for your personal protection, require you to verify your identity before we honor the request. In cases where the request is unreasonably repetitive, requires disproportionate technical effort, risks the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, METUS may reject the request and work with you to find an alternative solution. Please note that requests made over the phone may be recorded to ensure proper response to your request.</p>
          <p>To request more details about the personal information that you directly provided to METUS, click the appropriate web link above or contact METUS at 1-833-638-1096 for assistance. Please note that we require certain pieces of personal information, such as name, and email address or telephone number in order to find you in our systems. This may be more information than we have collected previously. METUS will respond to any such request in an appropriate manner and within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
          <p>METUS operates in such a way to protect information from accidental or malicious destruction. As such, subsequent to your request to delete personal information from our system, we reserve the right to retain residual copies from our active servers for a short period of time and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>

          <h3>Metahvac Ads And Offerings On Third-Party Websites</h3>
          <p>METUS may contract with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties. In addition, some websites may be “powered by” a service provider to provide METUS offers on METUS’s behalf. These service providers may send cookies and use web beacons on these third-party websites and on our Sites. The cookies and web beacons may enable METUS to collect information about the pages you viewed and the links you clicked.</p>
          <p>Most web browsers offer you the ability to inform websites and ad networks that you do not want your online activities tracked through a “Do Not Track” feature. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many online services, METUS does not currently alter its practices when it receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor’s browser.</p>
          <p>To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" class="ext">http://www.aboutads.info/<span class="ext"><span class="element-invisible"> (link is external)</span></span></a> to learn more about network advertising and your choices for opting out. However, METUS is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their tracking technologies. METUS is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of third party choice notices or choice mechanisms.</p>

          <p class="updated">Last updated: January 1, 2020</p>

          <h3>Commitment To Privacy On The Internet</h3>

          <p>METUS collects visitor data to analyze and understand important trends and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may choose to use this information in our marketing and advertising services. To achieve this end, METUS may utilize a technology referred to as “cookies” to ascertain various user habits such as the number of people who visit our Site, average browsing time, the number of time our Site is accessed, and how much of the Site is viewed. A cookie is a tiny data file transferred by a website to your computer’s hard drive for the purpose of storing small amounts of information. METUS collects information in aggregate for statistical purposes to improve our Site and better personalize your user experience. METUS does not review information on individuals themselves.</p>
          <p>A cookie can be described as either “session” or “tracking.” Session cookies are deleted after closing your browser. Tracking cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or upon expiration. METUS does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information and does not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information in an attempt to expose your identity, screen name, e-mail address or any other personal information.</p>
          <p>You can set your browser to send notifications before you receive a cookie, which gives you the ability to decide whether or not to accept it. You can also choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Because browsers vary, you should check your browser’s “Help” menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences. If you do so, however, areas of some sites may not function properly.</p>
