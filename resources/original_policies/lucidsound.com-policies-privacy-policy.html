<p><u>Updated</u>: January 5, 2021</p>
<p>At Lucid Sound (a part of ACCO Brands USA LLC), we are committed to respecting your privacy. One part of doing that is being transparent to you about how we collect, use, store, transfer and disclose information you share with us.&nbsp; This notice explains our approach and also lets you know about the rights you have over your information.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding your information or this notice, you can reach us anytime at <a href="mailto:DataPrivacy@acco.com">DataPrivacy@acco.com</a>.</p>
<h1><span>What are the key points of this notice?</span></h1>

</li>
<li>Our company uses third-party service providers to help us maintain and protect our website, accept payments, deliver products to you, send marketing communications, and tailor our site to your interests.</li>
<li>We do not sell and will not sell your information to third parties for their own use.</li>
<li>You have rights over how the information we collect about you is used. For example, you can opt-out of marketing communications at any time. You can also request access to the information we hold about you or request that we delete that information in some cases. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h1><span>What is the scope of this notice?</span></h1>
<p>This notice explains how we use personal information—information that can be used to identify or contact an individual.&nbsp; It also explains how we use non-personal information—information that cannot, alone, be used to identify or contact an individual.</p>
<p>This notice applies to the website on which it is posted.&nbsp; It also applies to interactions with Lucid Sound via other channels, such as when you contact our customer support team or visit our facilities.&nbsp; This notice does not apply to Lucid Sound websites with different privacy notices or to third-party websites and platforms—like Facebook™, Twitter™, Instagram™, or YouTube™.</p>
<h1><span>What information do we collect from you? </span></h1>
<p>We collect and process your information when you interact with our websites, interact with our social media accounts, purchase our products, use our internet-connected devices, contact our customer service employees, or interact with our company in another manner. The information we may collect includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name, username, and password;</li>
<li>Your personal or business address, company name, email address, and phone number;</li>
<li>Your payment and delivery information, including billing and delivery address;</li>

<li>For business customers, we also collect creditworthiness and financial information, bank account details, the names of shareholders and management, tax identification numbers, national identification numbers, and identification documentation (where required).</li>
</ul>
<h1><span>What technologies do we use to collect information?</span></h1>
<p>Beyond information that you actively provide to us, we also collect information passively via various technologies.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies are small text files that websites save on our local device when you visit a site.&nbsp; When you return to a website or visit another website, the website may read the cookie.&nbsp; This allows websites to do a variety of things, such as remembering site preferences, creating a record of a visitor’s online activity, or identifying what parts of a site are visited most often.</p>
<p>We use various cookies on our website to deliver the best experience to visitors.&nbsp; You can control what cookies are placed on your device via your browser’s settings.</p>
<h2>Pixel Tags</h2>
<p>Pixel tags are tiny graphic images (also known as web beacons, action tags, or transparent GIF files). We use pixel tags to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell us which parts of the website you have visited and to measure the effectiveness of any searches you may perform;</li>
<li>Send you email messages in a format you can read and let us know when you have opened a message from us and whether you click on the links contained in the message; and</li>
<li>Together with our ad marketing partners, track your interaction with online advertising, measure the performance of a marketing effort, and for targeted advertising.</li>
</ul>
<h2>File Metadata</h2>
<p>If you submit a digital photo or other file to us, it may contain metadata or precise geolocation. If you do not want to share this data, you should delete the data before sharing it with us.</p>
<h2>Embedded Links</h2>
<p>Certain links in our emails and third-party websites may include tracking information embedded in the link.&nbsp; This tracking is accomplished via a redirection system that allows us to understand whether you clicked on the link and how the link is being used. &nbsp;In some cases, this non-personal information can be combined with personal information we have about you to improve our services and marketing campaigns.</p>
<h1><span>What information do we collect from third parties?</span></h1>
<p>In addition to information that we collect from you, we also collect information from third parties.</p>
<p><u>Product Feature Providers</u></p>
<p>For certain products, your personal information may be shared with third parties to provide additional functionality to those devices.&nbsp; For example, some products include voice control functionality via services like Amazon Alexa.&nbsp; In those cases, the collection and use of your data is controlled by the voice control provider, not ACCO Brands.&nbsp; We do not collect any personal information from these processes and do not collect or store any audio recordings.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Social Media Platforms</h2>
<p>When you log into social media platforms from this website, public information such as your username is shared with the social media platform, which may then in turn provide that information to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separately, we may also collect from social media platforms additional information about existing customers to build a more fulsome profile of your interests so that we can better target our marketing and advertisements. This can include any of the information mentioned above in the “What information do we collect from you?” section above.</p>

<h1><span>With whom do we share your information?</span></h1>
<p>We share your information with various entities around the world, including some in countries that have privacy laws that may differ from those where you are located.&nbsp; For all transfers, we ensure there are suitable safeguards, such as a legal adequacy decision, standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, and Privacy Shield certifications.

<h2>ACCO Brands Corporation Group</h2>
<p>We may transfer your personal information to other brands and companies in the ACCO Brands Corporation group (of which Lucid Sound is a part) in order to process orders, sweepstakes or for other marketing activities.</p>
<h2>Resellers and Dealers</h2>
<p>In some cases, Lucid Sound does not sell products directly on its website, but instead directs customers to make purchases from a reseller or dealer.&nbsp; We may share your information with those entities to assist you, for example to facilitate having the reseller or dealer provide you with a price quote or product support.</p>
<h2>Service Providers</h2>
<p>We will also transfer the personal information described in the “What information do we collect from you?” section above to service providers, who will process information on behalf of Lucid Sound for the above-described purposes. These processors include providers of website hosting and maintenance, marketing database hosting, call center operation, consumer engagement, advertising, shipping, and logistics services.</p>
<h2>Analytic Providers</h2>
<p>We use analytic providers such as Google Analytics to analyze your use of our website. In this context, we transfer anonymized data about the use of our website to Google Inc. Google then compiles statistical reports for us about the use of our website.</p>
<h2>Social Media Platforms</h2>
<p>At various places on our websites we have implemented social network/ social media features. These features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Links to Lucid Sound’ websites on social networks</li>
<li>“Like” or “Share” buttons</li>
<li>Embedded content, such as videos</li>
</ul>
<p>The providers of the features above may use embedded content to identify you, the source of a visit and how you use our website.</p>
<p>When you use the recommendation functions, this communicates the URL of the respective website to the social network you have selected. A number of networks then immediately supplement the link with an excerpt of the content provided by our website. With most social networks, you are asked for confirmation before this is saved or forwarded.</p>
<p>We have integrated social media tools from social media providers such as: Facebook™, Twitter™, YouTube™, and Instagram™.</p>
<p>Please note that we do not have control of how these entities deal with the information you share with them and whether this information is made available to others. We recommend that you read their privacy policies carefully.</p>
<h2>Legal Disclosures</h2>
<p>We may disclose your information when required by law to do so, such as when information is subject to a subpoena or court order, or in furtherance of Lucid Sound’ legal interests, such as when defending or pursuing a legal claim. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Purchaser of Our Business</h2>
<p>If our business or a part of our business is sold or integrated into a different company, we may disclose your information to our advisors and to the advisors of the potential purchaser and will pass such information on to the new owners of the company.</p>
<h1><span>What rights do you have?</span></h1>

<p>If you would like to exercise your rights via an authorized agent, we require a signed authorization or power of attorney, which can be submitted to <a href="mailto:DataPrivacy@acco.com">DataPrivacy@acco.com</a>.&nbsp; We also require you, as the consumer, to directly verify your own identity with our company.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Your rights may be limited, for example, if during the fulfillment of your request, information about another person would be disclosed or if you ask us to delete information that we are legally required to store or need to operate our business.</p>
<p>When submitting a request for a copy of your personal information, we require that you provide your email address, full name, address, telephone number, and date of birth.&nbsp; We utilize that information to verify your identity with a third-party service provider.&nbsp; This is done to protect your information and ensure that the right information is provided to the right person.</p>
<h2>Non-Discrimination</h2>
<p>Lucid Sound does not discriminate against individuals exercising their rights over their information and it does not offer any financial incentives in connection with the collection, sale, or deletion of your personal information.&nbsp; In some cases, however, failure to provide information may result in us being unable to provide certain services, such as processing payments and fulfilling orders.</p>
<h2>Complaints</h2>
