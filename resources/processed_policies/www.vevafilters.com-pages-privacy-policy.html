            Veva Privacy Policy
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We are writing to let you know that Veva is now a Thrasio company. Thrasio is the fastest growing acquirer of Amazon businesses. The exponential growth of the Amazon ecosystem has lead to the creation of thousands of multimillion dollar niche brands, virtually overnight. Many of these companies lack the capacity to sustain further growth without the influx of capital or nuanced expertise. That’s where Thrasio steps in.
    </p>
    <p>
        As part of operating the Veva, we have updated the
        <a href="https://www.vevafilters.com/pages/privacy-policy">
            Privacy Policy
        </a>
        to reflect how Thrasio collects, uses, and shares your personal information. Under this new Privacy Policy, we will share your information with other Thrasio brands so that they can market their own products to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new Privacy Policy will become effective on October 8, 2020. If you do nothing, we will handle your information as the new Privacy Policy describes, starting on that date.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not want the new Privacy Policy to apply to your information, please click on the unsubscribe link below, and we will remove your information from our mailing list.

        Veva is a Thrasio brand. This Privacy Policy describes Veva’s privacy practices, and the rights and choices available to individuals with respect to their information.

            Targeted online advertising.

        Some of the business partners that collect information about users’ activities on or through our services may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior or mobile application usage for purposes of targeted advertising.

            here

        If you choose to opt out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you.

    </p>
    <p>
        This section applies only to California residents. For purposes of this section, “Personal Information” has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not sell personal information. Like most companies, we use cookies and other tracking tools to analyze website traffic and facilitate advertising. If you would like to opt out of our (and our third party advertising partners’) use of cookies and other tracking technologies, please review the instructions provided in the Online tracking opt-out guide below.

    <p>
        <strong>
            Your California privacy rights.
        </strong>
        The CCPA grants individuals whose information is governed by the CCPA the following rights:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Information.
            </strong>
            You can request information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months. We have made this information available to California residents without having to request it by including it in this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Access.
            </strong>
            You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Deletion.
            </strong>
            You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you.

        We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it.

    <p>
        <strong>
            Sensitive personal information.

        We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the services, or otherwise to us.

        We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

    <p>
        <strong>
            Your rights.

        In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as Flash technology to pixel tags to collect information automatically.

        <em>
            Browser Web Storage
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use browser web storage (including via HTML5), also known as locally stored objects (“LSOs”), for similar purposes as cookies. Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. Your web browser may provide functionality to clear your browser web storage.

    <p>
        <em>
            Flash Technology
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use Flash cookies (which are also known as Flash Local Shared Object (“Flash LSOs”)) on our Sites to collect and store information about your use of our Sites. Unlike other cookies, Flash cookies cannot be removed or rejected via your browser settings. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer or mobile device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our Sites.

        <em>
            Web Beacons
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.

            Mobile Application Software Development Kits (SDKs)
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) in our mobile applications. A SDK is third-party computer code that may be used for a variety of purposes, including to provide us with analytics regarding the use of our mobile applications, to integrate with social media, add features or functionality to our app, or to facilitate online advertising. SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly via our App.

        If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you.
