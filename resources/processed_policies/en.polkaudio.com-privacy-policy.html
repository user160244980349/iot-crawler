        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We may analyze your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information that we believe is relevant to you as opposed to information that is more general. We may also use additional information that's publicly available about you from other sources to do this more effectively. Your personal information also helps us to detect and reduce fraud. We do not use automated decision making.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will not sell your data to third parties. We have never done this, and we will not be doing this in the future.
    </p>
    What is the legal basis for obtaining my information under GDPR
    <p>
        The legal basis for processing your data is to fulfill the contract to provide with you with the product or service requested. For some data that you choose to provide beyond this, such as any address information or preferences you share, the legal basis for processing is consent. Where you have consented to the processing of your data, you may withdraw such consent by indicating that you wish to do so via
        <a href="mailto:privacy@soundunited.com">
            privacy@soundunited.com
        </a>
        . This withdrawal will be effective once received by us and processed and will apply to your data from that date forward. There may be cases in which we process your data based on legitimate interests such as fraud prevention. Processing basic computer and device information is necessary for the performance of our contract in order for you to use our app.
    </p>
    How long do you keep my information?
    <p>
        We keep your data until you instruct us otherwise such as by visiting our privacy center located at privacy@soundunited.com or it is either no longer needed in order to provide you with the products or services you have requested and then, unless there is a legal reason to keep it, it will be deleted as part of our normal, periodic updating of our user database or.
    </p>
    Who has access to your information?
    <p>
        We will not sell or rent your information to third parties. All communications to you will come from Sound United and its companies or brands. We will not share your information with third parties to allow them to market to you unless you have agreed to allow us to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do share your information with third parties for the reasons below but only with agreements in place governing their use of your information and their relationship with Sound United.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may instruct trusted third parties to perform services in respect of the processing of your personal data on our behalf. For example, when you use our apps we will utilize third party servers in order to store or provide you with information such as music content or other content that may be streamed from our servers to your Sound United products. If you enter into a transaction such as a purchase through one of our websites, we may have a third-party search engine process your order or fulfill it. These third parties specialize in such services and make your purchase faster and easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        With any of our affiliates and trusted third parties we have data processing or other agreements in place to protect your data in accordance with the applicable laws. The agreements with these business partners will limit the purposes for which your personal data can be used and disclosed, and will require your personal data to be adequately safeguarded.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may share anonymous data with third parties, but this will not be data that can be identified with you. For instance, we may share information about the total number of users for a particular service or product.
    </p>
    <p>
        From time to time, Sound United may sell a business or a part of a business to another company. Such a transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business to the purchasing company.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also need to disclose your personal information if it is required or requested as part of a legal order or legal process such as a subpoena or court demand. We are also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC, the Department of Transportation or any other U.S. authorized statutory body as part of our participation in the Privacy Shield.
    </p>
    Location of your personal information.
    <p>
        Sound United may store your personal data in a cloud. This means that your personal data may be processed on behalf of Sound United by a cloud service provider and could be stored in different locations around the world. Sound United makes use of organizational measures and endeavors to enter contracts with third parties to protect your personal data and to impose similar but in no way less restrictive requirements on our cloud services providers, including requirements that your personal data be processed exclusively for the purposes mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data is transferred to the United Stated based on standard contractual clauses in place between the controller and processor. We enter into contracts with data processors that provide that your data may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent you provide. The data processor will provide the same level of protection as we do and will notify us if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet this obligation. If we receive such a notification, then we will cause the data processor to stop processing personal data and take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate such failure. While your personal information is in another country, it may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in that country in accordance with its laws.
    </p>
    Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information
    <p>
        No data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the internet, email or other electronic communication methods and therefore you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your personal information, we use our best effort to ensure its security on our systems, to protect it against loss, misuse or alteration.
    </p>
