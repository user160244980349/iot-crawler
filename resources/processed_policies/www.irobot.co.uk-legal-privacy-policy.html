        We collect personal information from you, third parties, and certain Robots that are registered with us in order to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, to process and ship orders, to provide customer service and to communicate directly with you, to monitor and improve our Service, and to help us develop new products and services.
    </p>
    <p>
        The categories of information we collect are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Information you provide
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We collect and store personal information such as your name, email address, user name and password, shipping address, billing information, and phone number when you register for an iRobot account, shop online, sign up for offers, communicate with us or otherwise use our Service.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you register your Robot online or through mail or another registration means, we also collect information about your Robot, such as the Robot ID, serial number, or product code. We may also collect personal information when you send us an email, or provide us with comments, chat messages, and opinions either on our Website or through our Service.
        </li>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you log in to our Website or Apps through a third-party social network or authentication service, these services will authenticate your identity and may share your personal information with us (such as your name, email address, and profile information). Similarly, we may receive certain personal information if you interact with our accounts on a social network, such as by “Liking” or “Following.” The data we receive from these third-party services is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Service.

        We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, to process and ship orders, to provide customer service and to communicate directly with you, to monitor and improve our Service, and to help us develop new products and services.

            Appendix 1

        sets out more detailed information about the categories of personal information we collect about you and how we use that information.

    <p>
        <strong>
            Information We Collect from Registered Devices Equipped with Smart Technology.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of our Robots are equipped with smart technology which allows the Robots to transmit data wirelessly to the Service.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Robot and App usage data.
            </strong>
            When you register your Robot with the online App, we collect information about the Robot, such as a Robot name and device number, and information about the Robot and/or App usage, such as battery life and health.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Robot environment information.
            </strong>
            Certain Robot models are equipped to collect information about the environment in which the Robot is deployed. For example, the Robot collects information about the level of dirt detection and the Wi-Fi signal strength in each location and information about its movement throughout the environment to create a location ‘map’ of the Robot’s domain and the existence and type of objects (chair, desk, fridge, etc.) or obstacles encountered.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                iRobot Beta Programme.
            </strong>
            You can opt in to the iRobot Beta Programme made available within the App, which enables additional experimental Robot and/or App functionality. Certain features require additional data collection in order to support that particular feature. Each feature in the Beta Programme requires your opt-in permission to enable that functionality. The information required to support that Beta feature is not collected or used as part of the iRobot Beta Programme unless you choose to participate. Any information collected under this programme is subject to the same or functionally similar physical, administrative, and technological safeguards as other mission-related information collected under normal Robot use.
        </li>

        The table in
        <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/annex-2">
            Appendix 2
        </a>
        sets out the categories of personal information we collect from you and your Robot when you allow your Robot to transmit such information to us, and how we use that information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Robots do not transmit this information unless you register your Robot online and connect to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, or connect to the internet via another method. It is possible to use our smart technology Robots without Wi-Fi or Bluetooth data transmission, simply by disconnecting your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth from the Robot or by never connecting it at all. You can also choose through your settings in the App to not have map data transmitted to us.
