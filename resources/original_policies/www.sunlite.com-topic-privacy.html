<p><strong><span>Use of your Personal Information</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>Sunlite.com collects and uses your personal information to operate the Sunlite.com Web site and deliver the services you have requested. Sunlite.com also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Sunlite.com and its affiliates.

<p><strong><span>Use of Cookies</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>The Sunlite.com Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

<p><span>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Sunlite.com pages, or register with Sunlite.com site or services, a cookie helps Sunlite.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.

If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Sunlite.com services or Web sites you visit.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Security of your Personal Information</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>Sunlite.com secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Sunlite.com secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</span></p>
