You can manually decide to share such information and the Apps will access such stored information or files you select to use for various purposes in the Apps, including uploading such information to the Website
    </p>
    <p>
        Automatic Information Collection And Tracking
    </p>
    <p>
        As you navigate through and interact with our Website, or when you download, access and use the Apps, we may use automatic data collection technologies. These technologies do not identify you as an individual, but do collect information regarding your internet service provider, computer, mobile device and connected tools. An example of such technology would be the use of browser cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The type of such automatically collected information includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Usage Details. When you access and use the Apps, Website, or ONE-KEYTM Tools we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the Website, ONE-KEYTM Tools or Apps, including traffic data, location data, tool connection and performance data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on or through the Apps or Website.
        </li>
        <li>
            Computer Information. Information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type.
        </li>
        <li>
            Device Information. We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the device's unique device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information and the device's telephone number.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you do not want us to collect this information do not use the Website and do not download the Apps or delete them from your device.
    </p>
    <p>
        Collection Of Information And Geo-Location By ONE-KEYTM Tools
    </p>
    <p>
        The ONE-KEYTM Tools contain technology that identifies the serial number and type of the tool (saw, drill, etc.) and broadcasts this information as a “Notification” along with the tool’s geo-location to phones utilizing the ONE-KEYTM App in the surrounding area and to other internet enabled devices that the Company has authorized to be part of the ONE-KEYTM system (collectively “ONE-KEYTM Devices”). ONE-KEYTM Tools do not collect or store personally identifying information. Accordingly, Notifications do not contain personally identifying information. Instead, you can create an account and provide your personal information on our ONE-KEYTM App and link specific ONE-KEYTM Tools to your account on the ONE-KEYTM App. ONE-KEYTM App users may only access and view the Notification and geo-location information transmitted by those ONE-KEYTM Tools that they specifically link to their ONE-KEYTM App. All ONE-KEYTM Devices, however, monitor for and receive Notifications from any ONE-KEYTM Tool, even if the ONE-KEYTM Device is not specifically associated with that ONE-KEYTM Tool. The ONE-KEYTM Device will, from time to time, transmit any One Key Tool's geo-location and Notification information that it has detected and received to Company. Furthermore, no information regarding the ONE-KEYTM Device is provided to the ONE-KEYTM Tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        The detection and transmission of Notification data by the ONE-KEYTM App may be disabled at any time by a feature on the ONE-KEYTM App. When disabled, the ONE-KEYTM App will not transmit the location of your phone or any Notifications or geolocation from any ONE-KEYTM Tools. The broadcasting by ONE-KEYTM Tools or their Notifications and geo-location, however, cannot be disabled or turned off.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, users of the ONE-KEYTM App or ONE-KEYTM program on the Website can manually link a ONE-KEYTM Tool to their “inventory” in their ONE-KEYTM user account (“User Inventoried ONE-KEYTM Tool”). Information concerning this User Inventoried ONE-KEYTM Tool (tool settings, tool location, serial number and other information) will be collected and stored by the ONE-KEYTM App and uploaded to the users account on the Website where it will be accessible to the user. The ONE-KEYTM App or ONE-KEYTM program on the Website can control the settings of the User Inventoried ONE-KEYTM Tool. Furthermore, a user can create a guest account (“Guest Account”) on the ONE-KEYTM App or the Website. A user can allow or disallow a Guest account User using the ONE-KEYTM App or ONE-KEYTM program on the Website to: connect to a User Inventoried ONE-KEYTM Tool and change the tools settings; connect to a User Inventoried ONE-KEYTM Tool and lock or unlock the User Inventoried ONE-KEYTM Tool; access a listing of all the One Key Tools in a users inventory; add or edit ONE-KEYTM Tools to a user's inventory. Note that the above features of the ONE-KEYTM App may not be available for all versions of the ONE-KEYTM App or for all ONE-KEYTM App tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        How We Use Your Information
    </p>
    <p>
        We use information that we collect to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            For any other purpose with your consent.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Additionally, if you are a user of the Apps and decide to use the Apps to link to your tools, we can use the data to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Track performance data of a particular tool or suite of tools owned by you and used with the Apps or Website
        </li>

            Provide support and repair service to you regarding your tools.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare reports and logs of tool use, performance, and track battery life of tool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unlock the tools on behalf of the user
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you use a ONE-KEYTM Tool, the Notification and geo-location of the ONE-KEYTM Tool may be detected and transmitted by any ONE-KEYTM Device and sent to us. If that ONE-KEYTM Tool is associated with the ONE-KEYTM App, we will use this Notification information and geo-location to provide you information about your ONE-KEYTM Tool through your ONE-KEYTM App. If the Notification information and geo-location is not associated with a specific user, we will use that information for our analytical purposes, to develop and improve products and services, and internal business purposes.
    </p>

                CCPA Request
            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may only make a verifiable consumer request to exercise your rights under the CCPA twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
        </li>
        <li>
            Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Response Timing, Verification and Format:
    </p>
    <p>
        We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you make a request, we will attempt to verify your request as follows to ensure that we provide your personal information only to you or your authorized representative:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Account Users: We will verify your identity using our standard authentication means associated with your account with us.
        </li>
        <li>
            Users Without an Account: We will verify your identity via first name, last name, email address and phone number.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out"). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
        To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following web page link:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/0bcd3d0d-df9d-4291-9bd5-f276c7dae8aa/c5ed10b1-7ea6-4af4-839e-b31008e11e5c.html">
            Do Not Sell My Personal Information
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-Discrimination:
    </p>
    <p>
        We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Deny you goods or services.
        </li>
        <li>
            Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
        </li>
        <li>
            Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
