        Endeavor Business Media uses cookies and other internet technologies in the management of our Web Sites and email programs in an effort to enrich your online experience. "Cookies" are small text files containing small amounts of information that are sent to your computer's browser and stored on your device when you visit a website. Upon your first visit to our Web Sites, a cookie will be sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Many major web services use cookies to provide useful features for their users, such as letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience. They can also help to ensure that advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. Our cookies do not contain any information that is personally identifiable.

        Like many web sites, Endeavor Business Media uses pixel tags, also known as web beacons, clear gifs, or web bugs, which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of the Web Sites and collect usage data. We may use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third-party advertisers, service providers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit, including the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears, the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our Web Sites and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you. Pixel tags help us improve our understanding of our web traffic and visitor behavior, as well as gauge the response to our promotional efforts.

    <p>
        We use industry-standard, third party advertising service companies, such as AdRoll, to target and serve advertisements when you visit our Sites or open our emails. These third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags, and other similar technologies to collect information about your visit to our Web Site, and other websites, in order to provide you with relevant advertisements about products, services, and events. These collection methods do not typically include your name, address, or telephone number. These elements also provide us with aggregate pictures of traffic patterns, which help us to improve your experience on our Web Sites and monitor advertising effort. This usage data we collect does is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Data.

    <p>
        Endeavor Business Media collects information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual (we refer to this type of information in this Privacy Policy collectively as “Personal Data”) that you choose to provide us when you subscribe to our magazines, sign up for e-newsletters, enter a contest, participate in surveys, login into our Web Sites using a third party login system (including, but not limited to, Facebook Connect, Twitter, etc.), register for a Web Site, webcast, or trade show, or otherwise communicate with us. When you provide this information to us, you are no longer anonymous.
        <br/>
        We refer collectively to all information we collect that is not Personal Data, including usage data collected from cookies, pixels and similar technologies discussed in this Privacy Policy, demographic data and de-identified Personal Data, as "Non-Personal Data". If we combine Non-Personal Data with Personal Data, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        ​
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use your contact information to send notices for subscription renewal or provide you with information about products or services you have ordered with us. We may also use your contact information to send you e-newsletters or other promotional e-mails that contain targeted, relevant content that may be useful to your business. All promotional e-mails you receive from us will include an option to opt out of similar e-mail communications in the future.
        <br/>
        We may include Personal Data, such as your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address, as well as “demographic” information such as the type of business you work for, your job responsibilities and certain information about your company. We will tell you at the time we collect information whether the information requested is necessary for you to participate in a particular feature. The information we collect is used to respond to your specific requests, to send you periodic information and special offers from Endeavor Business Media and our sponsors, to provide you with updates on Endeavor Business Media offerings and features, to provide you with product information from manufacturers in our database, and to provide our sponsors and business partners with data about our users.
        <br/>
        We may disclose aggregated information about users and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the public. In the unlikely event that all of Endeavor Business Media’s assets or substantially all of its assets are acquired, then user and customer information, which may include Personal Information, may be one of the transferred assets.

Each third party Web Site has its own information collection and use practices, and we advise you to review their policies.

Endeavor Business Media will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail.

        <br/>
        In addition, any personally identifiable information or sensitive data that you choose to disclose through any discussion boards or other public online forums hosted on the Web Sites may be collected and used by others.

        Our Site uses ‘SSL’ to protect Personal Data. By using a browser that supports security functions, when you access to our Web Sites and enter Personal Data, including your name and e-mail address, this information is transferred to our server and the information is automatically encrypted when transmitted and received by servers. Therefore if the transmitted data is intercepted by a third party, there is no need to worry about the content being stolen.
        <br/>
        If you use a browser that does not support SSL, you may not be able to access our Web Site or input information.

        Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of Web Sites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different Web Sites. Our Web Sites do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity while you are using our Web Sites.

        This section (“California Statement”) explains rights that certain natural persons residing in the State of California (each, a “consumer”) may have under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and such rules and regulations as may be adopted from time to time implementing and interpreting such Act (collectively, “CCPA”). When we use the term “personal information” in this California Statement, we are using that term as CCPA defines it, which CCPA generally defines “personal information” to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. However, personal information does not include publicly available, deidentified, or aggregate consumer information (which are all defined in CCPA). Also, the definition of “personal information” also does not currently apply to the collection of personal information from job applicants, employees (whether you are our employee or any employee of our customers), business owners, directors, officers, medical staff or contractors.
        <br/>
        Where we act as a “business” under CCPA (meaning we determine the manner and reasons for why we process your personal information), we may be required to disclose additional information regarding the categories of personal information we collect, the sources where we obtain that information, the purposes for why we collect that information, who we share that information with, as well as whether we sell that personal information – all of which depends on the specific service being provided.
