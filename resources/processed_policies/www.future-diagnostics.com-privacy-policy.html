        Why we collect personal data
    </h2>
    <p>
        We collect personal data for managing our customer relationship with you. In the majority of cases, we receive the personal data from you directly, for example when you request additional information about our services from us. We use such data for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <p>
        To provide you the services and products you requested from us. This includes taking your order, delivering your order and processing invoices relating to that order. Where necessary, we also use your personal data for collecting overdue payments from you. All these actions result from the contract we have with you and they are necessary for fulfilling our obligations arising from our customer relationship with you.
        <br/>
        To answer your questions about our services or products or other requests.
        <br/>
        To send you invitations to our events maintaining our customer relationship with you. You always have the right to opt-out from such communication.
        <br/>
        In order to ensure that we process accurate information about you we use the services of external service providers to supplement the information you have provided to us and keep it up-to-date.
        <br/>
        We also collect data about you when you use our services, in order to meet your specific needs or wishes.

        Suppliers, and other important stakeholders
    </h2>
    <p>
        We collect personal information of our suppliers’ contact persons and about external service providers. We collect information also from other important stakeholders that are otherwise regarded important to our business. The information is collected from the person him/herself, from their employer or from public sources. We use the data for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <p>
        to manage the relationship between these stakeholders
        <br/>
        to communicate with our suppliers and other important stakeholders
        <br/>
        to be able to assess the fulfillment of defined requirements
        <br/>
        to manage and provide work orders
        <br/>
        we perform background screenings about our suppliers to check that the company is for example ISO certified.
