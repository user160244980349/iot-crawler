Ads - Online Advertisements</b></h2>
<p>This Site may display ads from other companies. We also partner with third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf on other non-affiliated third party sites or apps. Some of the ads on this Site or on third party sites or apps may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your device’s browsing activity. For example, anonymous information collected by our ad networks or other third-party service providers across multiple sites that you visit may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you. We may share your information with our service providers to permit them to recognize and serve targeted ads to you across the different devices you use. Before we share your information, we transform, or “hash”, it so that it is not in personally identifiable form.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising from us on other mobile or desktop sites, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">page</a>. You may download the AppChoices app at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a> to opt out of personalized in-app advertising.

<p>These opt-out mechanisms rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to ad-serving on websites. If you delete your cookies, use another computer or device, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process. In addition, opting out of interest-based ads will not opt you out of all ads, but rather only those ads that are personalized to your interests based on activities observed on our Site and/or web sites or mobile apps not owned and operated by Transformco. </p>

<p><a name="CCPA_Rights"><b><u>Your CCPA Rights </u></b></a></p>
<p><i><u>Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information</u></i></p>
<p>We do not sell your PI. For this reason, we do not treat PI collected by Transformco as subject to a Do Not Sell request and therefore, we do not offer a way for you to submit such a request. There is not yet an industry consensus as to whether third party cookies and tracking devices associated with our websites and mobile apps may constitute a “sale” of your PI as defined by the CCPA and as such, we do not treat such information as subject to a Do Not Sell request.</p>
<p>You can exercise control over browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser. For additional details about your choices regarding certain kinds of online interest-based advertising, see the section above titled <a href="https://www.sears.com/en_us/customer-service/policies/privacy-policy.html#PP7">"Interest-Based Ads - Online Advertisements"</a>.</p>
<p>Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as do-not-track signals, but as this is not an actual request from a person, we currently do not recognize these as a do-not-sell request. We understand that various parties are developing do-not-sell signals, and we may recognize certain such signals if we conclude such a program is appropriate. Note that we do not recognize do-not-track signals on a general basis either.</p>
<p>The CCPA requires that we state that we do not knowingly sell the PI of Consumers we know are under 16. </p>
<p>We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a sale:� (i) if you direct us to share PI; (ii) to comply with your requests under the CCPA; (iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute the Transformco family of companies, or as part of a merger or asset sale; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p><i><u>Rights to Know and Delete Personal Information</u></i></p>
<p>California Consumers have the right to exercise certain privacy rights under the CCPA. California Consumers may exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA. Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (“Verifiable Consumer Request”). We will not fulfill your CCPA request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI. </p>
<p>If you are unable to provide us with certain information about yourself or, in some cases, about your transaction history with us, we will be unable to verify your identity to fulfill a request to know or delete. As an initial matter, we require you to provide your name, address, email address, and phone number to be submitted via our online request form (linked below) or at the toll-free number below. In some cases, we may verify identity by confirming that you are the owner of the email address we have on file. For your specific pieces of information, as required by the CCPA, we will apply heightened verification standards, and reserve the right to request further information from you, in addition to the information mentioned above. </p>
<p>Some personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with a Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable
Consumer Requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. </p>
<p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. </p>
<p>You may use an authorized agent to submit a consumer rights request. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may require proof that the agent has been authorized by you to do so, and take other steps permissible under the CCPA, to ensure it is a proper request by an authorized agent. </p>
<p><u>a. The Right to Know</u></p>
<p><i>i. Categories</i></p>
<p>You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request
date:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of PI we have collected about you.</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.</li>
<li>The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your PI.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.</li>
<li>A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no disclosure occurred.</li>
<li>A list of the categories of PI sold about you in the prior 12 months, or that no sale occurred. If we sold your PI, we will explain:
<ul>
<li>The categories of your PI we have sold.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties to which we sold PI, by categories of PI sold for each third party.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>ii. Specific Pieces</i></p>
<p>You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining. </p>
<p>Please note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not be able to fully respond to what might be relevant going back 12 months prior to the request.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
<p><u>b. The Right to Deletion</u></p>
<p>You may request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining. Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you. Exceptions do apply, including, without limitation, where we need to retain your personal information for regulatory reasons, to complete a warranty or other contract with you, or other internal uses of the information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</p>
<p>To exercise the right to know or right to delete, you may submit a request by calling us at 888-527-6415 or online at <a href=" https://transformco.com/privacy/request/kenmore"> https://transformco.com/privacy/request/kenmore</a>. In order to complete your request, you will be required to respond to any follow up inquires we may make, and we may deny your request if you do not do so. Transformco will not discriminate against any consumer for exercising these rights, as described further below.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
<p><i><u>Notice of Financial Incentive and Non-Discrimination</u></i></p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data. In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale, and retention and use of your PI as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels, such as those offered under our Shop Your Way Program. The Shop Your Way Program offered at TransformCo stores is a rewards program where members earn points while shopping. There is no program membership fee. In order to participate, TransformCo must retain certain personal information, including those categories disclosed above. For complete information please see the Shop Your Way Terms and Conditions <a href="https://www.kenmore.com/help/policies/about-shop-your-way">here</a>. The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms, including the Shop Your Way Terms and Conditions linked in the previous sentence. Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional, you will have to affirmatively opt-in to the program and you can opt-out of each program (i.e., terminate participation and forgo the ongoing incentives) prospectively by following the instructions in the applicable program description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your CCPA rights. In addition, we need not honor any of your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or any other person or party’s rights or conflict with applicable law.</p>
<p><b>California Shine the Light Law</b></p>
<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of PI to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. Separate from your CCPA "Do Not Sell" rights, you have additional rights regarding disclosure of your information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may request information about our compliance with Shine the Light by contacting us at <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@kenmore.com?subject=California%20Shine%20the%20Light%20Law%20Request" target="_blank">dataprivacy@kenmore.com</a> or by sending a letter to</p>

<p>Any such request must include “California Shine the Light Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address or mail address.</p>
