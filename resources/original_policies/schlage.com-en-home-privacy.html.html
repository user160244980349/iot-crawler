We are not responsible for the privacy, security and information practices of such third-party websites.</p>
<p><b><a></a><a id="internationaltransfersandoffshorestorageofpersonaldata"></a>9. International Transfers and Offshore Storage of Personal Data</b></p>
<p>We may use, disclose, process, transfer or store information, including personal data, outside the country in which it was collected, such as to the United States and other countries, which may not guarantee the same level of protection for personal data as the country in which you reside.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are situations when personal data is transmitted to third-party service providers (in the United States and/or other countries, including countries in which Allegion operates or has offices) to provide services for Allegion, such as payment processing and web hosting and other services required by law. Allegion uses third-party service providers to process personal data for service-related and administrative purposes. Such service providers are located in the United States and other locations where Allegion does business. When Allegion retains another company to perform a function of this nature, such third party will be required to protect the personal data and will not be authorized to use the personal data for any other purpose.</p>
<p>The countries that we may use, disclose, process, transfer or store your information in are likely to be Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Panama, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UAE, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>With regard to residents in the EU: your personal data will only be transmitted outside the EU or the European Economic Area if the other conditions for such transmission under the GDPR are fulfilled (e.g., signing of EU standard contractual clauses with the service provider(s) pursuant to Art. 46 (2) c) GDPR).</p>
<p><b><a></a><a id="securityofpersonaldata"></a>10. Security of Personal Data</b></p>
<p>We may store your personal data in electronic format. We have implemented reasonable measures to protect the personal data we collect from damage, misuse, interference, loss, alteration, destruction, unauthorized or accidental use, modification, disclosure, access or processing, and other unlawful forms of processing data. However, please be aware no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. While we monitor and maintain the security of the Allegion Applications, we do not guarantee that the Allegion Applications or any products or services are impervious to attack or that any use of the Allegion Applications or any products or services will be uninterrupted or secure. In addition, information that you transmit over the Internet, including through e-mail or SMS message, is not secured by us and is inherently vulnerable to attack or interception.</p>
<p><b><a></a><a id="retentionofpersonaldata"></a>11. Retention of Personal Data</b></p>
<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as we have a reasonable legal or commercial need for it, after which time we will destroy it through currently available secure destruction means. Personal data collected for recruitment purposes will be retained for a reasonable period of time in accordance with applicable law, unless you are hired in which case some of this information will be stored in your employment record.</p>
<p><b><a></a><a id="yourrightsandchoices"></a>12. Your Rights and Choices</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Your rights. </i>You provide your personal data to us voluntarily. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right, at any time, to learn whether Allegion processes personal data about you, to request information as to your personal data being processed, to access personal data that Allegion holds about you; to learn the purpose of the processing and to check whether the data is being processed in accordance with the original purpose, to request that we restrict the use of your personal data or stop using or disclosing your personal data; to request that we update, amend, or delete your personal data; to know the third parties to whom your personal data has been transferred, request third parties to be informed of any rectification, update, deletion, object to the occurrence of any result that is to your detriment by means of analysis of personal data exclusively through automated systems, request portability of your personal data or compensation for damages due to unlawful processing of your personal data and to withdraw any previously given consent with regard to your personal data; using the contact information below. Residents in the EU have the right to object to the processing of personal data, which we base on our legitimate interest, for reasons arising from your particular situation. Further information on our data processing operations and the legal basis on which they are based can be found in section 4 above. If you file an objection, we will no longer process your personal data, unless we can prove compelling reasons for the processing worthy of protection which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the enforcement, exercise or defense of legal claims. You may make such requests by submitting a request <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/8b164882-ffc8-4155-8514-dc33976fd253/ae8fbc7d-6b5e-45f4-af18-93748981f17f.html">here</a>.

In case it proceeds, we will answer your request within a term of 15 (fifteen) business days after the previous term.</p>
<p>You may revoke the consent that, as the case may be, you granted us for the handling of your personal data. However, it is important that you keep in mind that not in all the cases we will be able to answer your request or immediately conclude the use thereof as it is possible that due to some legal obligation we will be required to continue handling your personal data.

    <p><b>Additional Rights (from 25 May 2018)</b></p>
<p>As of 25 May 2018, with regard to personal data subject to the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union, you also have the following rights:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Data portability - </i>to the extent that we are relying upon the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party as the legal basis for processing, and that personal data is processed by automatic means, you have the right to receive all such personal data which you have provided to the Allegion in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible.</li>
<li><i>Right to restriction of processing - </i>you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal data where:<ul>
<li>you contest the accuracy of the personal data until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;</li>
<li>the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the data;</li>
<li>we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require them for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or</li>
<li>you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below) pending verification as to whether the Allegion has compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Where personal data is subjected to restriction in this way we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Right to object to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds - </i>to the extent that we are relying upon legitimate interest to process data, then you have the right to object to such processing, and we must stop such processing unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Normally, where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing, we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in your Member State of residence, if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>For further information regarding your rights, or to exercise any of your rights, please contact <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@allegion.com">dataprivacy@allegion.com</a>.</p>
