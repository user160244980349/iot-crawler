When you submit information to SmartGuy.com requesting our Services, you authorize us to share this information with our network of “<strong>Contractors and Service Professionals</strong>” (Contractors, Tradesmen, Architects, etc.) in order to try to provide the services you request. For example, when an approved member of our service professional network accepts a lead from a registered user, and that User indicates what personal information they are willing to share so that the Contractor or Service Professional can contact the User, such as telephone numbers and email addresses, that information is shared with our Contractors and Service Professionals who have accepted a service request lead. We may also post and publish users' Ratings and Reviews of Contractors' or Service Professionals' performance, as well as Feedbacks and Testimonials at our sole discretion.</p><p>If you communicate with us by e-mail, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or the like, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personally Identifiable Information.</p><p>Further, if you are a Contractor or Service Professional, we will collect your location information, if you enter your business address, to assist Users in identifying you as a potential service provider.
