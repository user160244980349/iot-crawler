<strong>COLLECTION OF OTHER INFORMATION</strong><br>
<br>
We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:<br>

<br>
<strong>Cookies (or browser cookies) and web beacons</strong><br>

<br>
<strong>IP Address&nbsp; </strong><br>
<br>
Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.&nbsp; An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the System, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.&nbsp; Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications, and other services.&nbsp; We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the System.&nbsp; We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.<br>
<br>
<strong>Physical Location&nbsp; </strong><br>
<br>
We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, or WiFi signals.&nbsp; We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.&nbsp; We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.&nbsp; In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.<br>

<strong>DATA INTEGRITY AND RETENTION</strong><br>
<br>
Generac will take reasonable steps to confirm that Personal Information about you is accurate, complete, and up-to date. &nbsp;We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.&nbsp; The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the System to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the System);</li>
	<li>Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or</li>
	<li>Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).</li>
</ul>
<strong>CHOICES AND ACCESS</strong><br>
<br>
Users of our System in certain jurisdictions may have rights in relation to the Personal Information that we collect about them. &nbsp;If you would like to request to review, correct, update, suppress, restrict, or delete Personal Information, object to the processing of Personal Information, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), you may contact us by email at <a href="mailto:legal.admin@generac.com">legal.admin@generac.com</a> or by mailing our Legal Department at S45 W29290 Hwy. 59, Waukesha, WI 53189. &nbsp;We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.<br>

<strong>IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</strong><br>

<strong>California Resident Rights</strong><br>
<br>
California law grants California residents certain rights and imposes restrictions on particular business practices as set forth below.<br>
&nbsp;
<div id="optout"><strong><em>Right to Opt-out of Sale of Personal Information</em></strong>.&nbsp; California residents have the right to opt-out of our sale of their personal information. &nbsp;We do not and will not sell your personal information.</div>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong><em>Notice at Collection</em></strong><em>.</em> At or before the point of collection, notice must be provided to California residents of the categories of personal information collected and the purposes for which such information is used.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong><em>Verifiable Requests to Delete and Requests to Know. </em></strong>Subject to certain exceptions, California residents have the right to make the following requests, at no charge:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<u>Request to Delete</u>: California residents have the right to request deletion of their personal information that we have collected about them and to have such personal information deleted, except where an exemption applies.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<u>Request to Know</u>: California residents have the right to request and, subject to certain exemptions, receive a copy of the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about them in the prior 12 months and to have this delivered, free of charge, either (a) by mail or (b) electronically in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily useable format that allows the individual to transmit this information to another entity without hindrance.&nbsp; California residents also have the right to request that we provide them certain information about how we have handled their personal information in the prior 12 months, including the:

<ul>
	<li>categories of personal information collected;</li>
	<li>categories of sources of personal information;</li>
	<li>business and/or commercial purposes for collecting and selling their personal information;</li>
	<li>categories of third parties/with whom we have disclosed or shared their personal information;</li>
	<li>categories of personal information that we have disclosed or shared with a third party for a business purpose;</li>
	<li>categories of personal information collected; and</li>

</ul>
California residents may make Requests to Know up to twice every 12 months.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong><em>Submitting Requests. </em></strong>Requests to Know and Requests to Delete may be submitted by emailing us at <a href="mailto:Privacy@generac.com">Privacy@generac.com</a>. &nbsp;We will respond to verifiable requests received from California consumers as required by law.<br>
&nbsp;
<div id="nondiscrimination"><strong><em>Right to Non-</em></strong><strong><em>Discrimination</em></strong><em>.</em> The CCPA prohibits discrimination against California residents for exercising their rights under the CCPA. Discrimination may exist where a business denies or provides a different level or quality of goods or services, or charges (or suggests that it will charge) different prices,&nbsp; rates, or penalties on residents who exercise their CCPA rights, unless doing so is reasonably related to the value provided to the business by the residents’ data.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong><em>Financial Incentives</em></strong>. A business may offer financial incentives for the collection, sale or deletion of California residents’ personal information, provided the incentive is not unjust, unreasonable, coercive or usurious, and is made available in compliance with applicable transparency, informed consent, and opt-out requirements. California residents have the right to be notified of any financial incentive offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time, and may not be included in such incentives without their prior informed opt-in consent. We do not offer any incentives at this time.<br>
