        </strong>
        We use other companies, agents or contractors (“Service Providers”) to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with providing services to you. For example, we engage Service Providers to process credit card transactions and other payment methods.

            GDPR Readiness at Zetronix
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        In December 2016, the EU Parliament and Council agreed upon the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), first proposed in 2012, to go into effect on May 25, 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
        GDPR offers a new framework for data protection with increased obligations for organizations. GDPR focuses on protecting personal data and handing control of it back to the subject of the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        We’ve been receiving a lot of questions from our Customers, Vendors, Prospects, and Partners. So we’ve provided some more information in the following areas:

            1. Customer GDPR Roll-Out
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Where customers are processing personal data with Zetronix, as this is against third party data sources, we are asking our customers to advise us on the lawful processing condition for using our products/services. This ‘reason’ why will need to be determined by our customer, as they are the Data Controller.
        <strong>
            Zetronix is the Data Processor who acts under their instruction.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are six lawful processing conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Compliance with a legal obligation
        </li>
        <li>
            Performance of a contract
        </li>
        <li>
            Legitimate interest
        </li>
        <li>
            Public interest
        </li>
        <li>
            Vital interest
        </li>
        <li>
            Consent
        </li>
    </ul>

            3. Data Mapping
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Zetronix has completed Article 30; our Data Mapping exercise. We know what data we have, where it’s held, how we access it, the classification of the data, records for transfer, and flowcharts to show how it moves between systems, processes and countries.

            4. Information Security
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Operations Team is focused on maintaining an information security program that covers everything you would expect and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        This includes technical security measures (e.g. intrusion, detection, firewalls, monitoring), restricted access to personal data, protection of our physical premises and hard assets, maintaining security measures for our team members (e.g. pre-screening), a data-loss prevention strategy and regular testing of our security posture across our product family: Zetronix.com, Soliur.com

        <strong>
            5. Privacy Impact Assessments
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Where appropriate, a Privacy Impact Assessment will be completed and evidence gathered, such as copies of privacy notices, a due diligence questionnaire, periodic testing.

        <strong>
            6. Responding to Subject Access Requests / Rectification / Deletion
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Zetronix has a process in place to manage these requests and sees no issue responding within the new GDPR required timescale of 30 days.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>
            7. Data Breach Reporting
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        The ICO or Information Commissioner’s Office has a Blog that clears up a lot of myths around data breach reporting. Art. 33 (2) states as a data processor, Zetronix’s obligation is to notify data controllers without undue delay after becoming aware of it. WP29 have provided some guidance on this which states:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            “The GDPR does not provide an explicit time limit within which the processor must alert the controller, except that it must do so “without undue delay”. Therefore, WP29 recommends an immediate notification by the processor to the controller, with further information about the breach provided in phases as information becomes available. This is important in order to help the controller to meet the requirement of notification to the supervisory authority within 72 hours.”
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Zetronix’s position is, the regulation states without “undue delay”, therefore this is what we will abide by. However, we recognize that for our Customer, the Data Controller, the clock will only start ticking when they become aware there has been an incident.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>
            8. Cookies &amp; Privacy Policy Update(s)
