    </p>
    <p>
        We will be happy to remove identifying information upon request, although some specific information may be kept for an appropriately limited time for the purposes of resolving accounting disputes, issues or audits, as well as to respect our returns policies and warranty commitments, including those commitments made to our vendors and partners.

        WarmlyYours has implemented a feature of Google Analytics called “Demographics and Interest Reporting.” This feature will gather broad information like the gender and age of visitors to our page, which will in turn help us develop the site and its content around our users’ interests. We will not sell or provide this information to any third-party.
