    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to all users of our products and services (“Consumers”), including those who have used our website (“Web Site”), which is owned by Centerfield Media Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Owner”). Please note that this policy applies only to this Web Site, and services wherein Security.org determines the purposes or means of processing your personal information, and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link, or business partners to whom we provide your information, based on your requests as relating to the product or service in which you are interest, and for whom we serve as service providers. Alternatively, the information Security.org collects on behalf of a third party, to whom we provide marketing services, may be subject to both this Privacy Policy, and the third party’s privacy policy. For more information on those companies or organizations’ personal information practices, and your rights, please visit their respective privacy policies.

Information that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized is not considered personal information. Publicly available information that is made available from federal, state, or local government records, also is not personal information.

    </p>
    <p>
        (10) information pertaining to internet or network activity such as a consumer’s interaction with an advertisement, and other information obtained from cookies and clear gifs, as described further below.

We may add the information we receive about you through those means to your existing account. Like other web sites, we also automatically receive and record certain types of information every time you visit us. We use “cookies” and the other information to enhance your experience and present you with personalized offers. Likewise, we use third-party advertising companies to distribute and track advertisements appearing on our web site. These companies may employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. More information about cookies can be found in our Cookies and IP Addresses section below.

    <p>
        At any point, Security.org reserves the right to collect additional consumer information. This Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly to reflect those changes.

    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies and IP Addresses
    </p>
    <p>
        To serve you more efficiently and effectively, we use “cookies” technology. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive that contains information about the user. Cookies are not way linked to Consumer PII. Once the user closes their browser, a cookie typically terminates. Cookies enable a web site to “personalize” itself for each user and reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer. In order to optimize your experience, cookies also help with the collection of customer tracking data. We may also capture customer tracking data on some of our partner’s web sites, related to activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our web site. This information is used to monitor the performance of our partners. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited. We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and may disclose your IP address during the course and scope of our business. An IP Address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your browser or device may offer settings that allow you to choose whether browser cookies are set and to delete them. For more information about these controls and to exercise your cookie preferences, visit your browser or device’s help material. If you choose to reject cookies, as noted above, you may not be able to use certain features of our websites and services. To learn more about Cookies, visit

    </p>
    <p>
        Some of our non-affiliated business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over such cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of our cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clear Gifs
    </p>
    <p>
        We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web users. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section within any email you receive from us.

        <strong>
            Sharing of Your Personal Information
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Except as expressly set forth herein, (i) we do not sell your personal information, and (ii) Security.org also does not share your personal information with partners or providers associated with other domains owned by Owner, the owner of Security.org.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may share your personal information to the following categories of third parties, and/or under the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Partners, sponsors, advertisers, service providers and marketers lookup and reference services and any other entities that Security.org believes are able to provide Consumers with special offers and opportunities, including retail opportunities, that relate to the requests you have made. These businesses include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing. In each case, you will have agreed to receiving such information. For example, if you have requested a quote for a service from a particular company, we will share your information with that company to facilitate your request.
        </li>
        <li>
            With other persons, if we believe it is necessary to 1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries; (3) comply with valid legal process; or (4) protect the rights or property of Security.org, Security.org’s web sites or other Consumers.
        </li>
        <li>
            In connection with, or during the negotiation of, any merger, sale of company stock or assets, financing, acquisition, divestiture, or dissolution of all or a portion of the business. Any successor company will continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy, unless it is modified as described by this policy.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When you request quotes or request to be contacted through Security.org or our other sites that we operate, you are authorizing us to share information with our business partners who will contact you by (i) phone, including without limitation any prerecorded telephone call to any telephone number including without limitation any wireless telephone number, which could result in charges to you, (ii) SMS text message, (iii) email, or (iv) mail. We may also contact you through any of the above means. If you do not want further communication from them or us, please notify the person or entity that contacts you directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, Security.org may share Consumer PII in aggregate (non-personal information), with select companies that wish to reach a particular Consumer target audience (e.g., female Consumers between the ages of 25-35, who have an average household income of over $50,000.00). This information will allow these entities to provide relevant offers to specific Consumers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Security.org prohibits the sale or transfer of Consumer PII to non-affiliated entities for their use without giving you the opportunity to opt-out. Although Security.org advises everyone who receives Consumer PII from Security.org to support this Privacy Policy, Security.org has no control over such party’s information handling practices and is not responsible for any failure of such party to adhere to this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Service Providers
    </p>
    <p>
        In some cases, we may require the use third party vendors, outside companies, to operate portions of the Security.org web site and/or to provide certain services including clerical, information processing and shipping services. The particular section of the web site may have a similar appearance as the Security.org site, and information submitted through these outside third parties are subject to this Privacy Policy unless otherwise stated.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you sign up for our services, we will share only as much information as is necessary for the provision of those services. We require that all third parties, hired by Security.org, comply with our Privacy Policy in order to keep your information safe and secure. These third parties are prohibited from using or sharing your personal information for any purpose other than the job they were hired to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        Advertisements &amp; Pop Up Windows
    </p>
    <p>
        On occasion, you may receive advertisements for Security.org from third parties. These advertisements are served by the third party web site that you have visited or directly from this website or any site owned by the owner of Security.org. In addition, such advertisements may be placed by third party ad servers or ad networks. We maintain relationships with a number of the third party ad networks currently operating. You may find more information at the web site of either the individual ad network or the network advertising initiative. Your relationships, transactions and any opt-out requests with any such third party are governed by the specific policy such third party has, and not those of Security.org.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Opting-Out
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We offer you choices when we ask for personal information, whenever reasonably possible. We provide you the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personal information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. You may decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some of our features or services may not function properly as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you no longer wish to receive newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing or calling us per the information contained on our contact page. You may continue to receive email communications from us up to ten (10) business days from the time we receive your unsubscribe request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that Security.org can only control its own mailing list and policies. Our business partners may maintain their own mailing lists, and you may need to contact these parties directly in order to stop receiving their communications. Third party advertisers may also advertise our services, and you may have provided those third party advertisers consent to receive those communications directly. Where that is the case, you may need to contact those third parties directly in order to stop receiving their communications. Although Security.org only supports permission-based emails, Security.org does not obligate itself to restrict third parties advertising Security.org beyond that which is required by applicable law.

            Third Party Links
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to all information that Security.org collects. However, when you visit web sites to which Security.org provides a link, keep in mind you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security policies, and terms of use. If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party site, the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party’s privacy policy. A third party site will also have its own policy regarding the use of cookies and clear gifs. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of any other service provider from whom you request services.

        Companies that collect personal information from California residents and disclose such information to Third Parties (including affiliated entities) for marketing purposes must, in response to a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided, or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having their information shared with Third Parties. We have elected the second option and you may request that your personal information not be shared with Third Parties by sending your request, including your full name, email address and postal address to:
        <a href="mailto:info@security.org">
            info@security.org
