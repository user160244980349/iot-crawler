The information we collect when you use -our Service includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>

<p>When you use the Service, we collect information about your activity on the Sites and how you interact with the Service, such as your preferences as to products or purchases, browser type, domain names, number of page views, login frequency, page or section accesses.</p>
<p><u>System Information</u></p>
<p>We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Service, such as your IP address and unique device identifiers.</p>
<p><u>Information Collected By Cookies And Other Technologies:</u></p>
<p>Cookies:</p>
<p>When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies—small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters—to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.</p>
<p><u>Automatically Collected Information</u></p>
<p>When you use the Service, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.</p>
<p><strong><u>Information We Get From Third Parties </u></strong></p>
<p><u>Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons</u></p>
<p>We may also implement third-party content or advertising on the Service that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as the Pinterest "Pin It" button) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through those third parties' browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and YDesign Group does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. Please see "More Information about Advertising" below to learn about how we work with third parties for our advertising.</p>
<p><u>Third Party Service Providers; Google Analytics</u></p>
<p>We may work with different companies and third party service providers who offer services that can assist us in better understanding how users of our Service interact with and use our Service or otherwise assist us in providing the Service ("Third Party Service Providers"). We may permit such Third Party Service Providers to use certain technologies, including without limitation web beacons and cookies, to collect certain personal information or non-personally identifiable information in connection with the provision of such services to us. For example, we currently use and may continue to use a product called Google Analytics by permitting Google Inc. to use technologies such as web beacons and cookies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information that helps us understand your usage of our Service. We may permit Google and other third party analytics providers to combine information collected through our Service with information collected from third party services, and these analytics providers may use this information to help us better understand our users, and these analytics providers may also use this information to help their other customers better understand their users. Additionally, we currently use and may continue to use a version of Google Analytics called Google Analytics for Display Advertisers, which enables Google to collect, use, and disclose information in connection with certain advertising activities. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads at <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a>.</p>
<p><u>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</u></p>
<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to Customers' personally identifiable information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. Also, clear gifs, which may be set by a third party, are used on pages to track sales, which may result from our Internet advertising campaigns and banner advertisements appearing on other web sites. In order to track the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, aggregate data pertaining to the dollar amount spent, items purchased, and campaign the customer responded to, is sent to third party servers for the purpose of tracking which sales resulted from specific advertising campaigns and to track conversion sales coming from banner advertisements. No individually identifiable data is sent to third party servers, only data that reflects that a sale occurred. If Customers would like to opt-out of these e-mails, they should see the Opt-out section.</p>
<p><u>Integrated Services</u></p>
<p>You may be given the option to access, register for, or place an order on the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an "Integrated Service"), such as through the use of your PayPal account credentials, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide personal information or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store the information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.</p>
<p><u>Information from Other Sources</u></p>
<p>We may obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers, and Integrated Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Policy.</p>

<p><strong>More Information </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>bout </strong><strong>Our Third Party </strong><strong>Advertising</strong><strong> Practices </strong></p>
<p>We may work with third party companies to help us tailor advertising on our Service and to place ads on other unaffiliated sites and services. In connection with this advertising, these third party companies may use information about your use of the Service, such as information about the pages and products that you have viewed. These third party companies may then use this information to show you advertisements on our Service or on non-affiliated sites based on your use of our Service. In some cases, these third party companies may combine the information related to your use of our Service (if any) with information related to your use of non-affiliated sites or services, and then use that combined information to display advertisements that may be relevant to your interests. In the course of providing these services or placing advertisements, these third party companies may use technologies that enable them to identify your device or browser, web beacon technologies, place or recognize one or more unique cookies on your computer, and may record information to these cookies based upon your activities on our Service and on third-party websites and services. Each of these companies uses the information they collect according to their own privacy and security policies. To learn more about these companies and these practices, and to opt-out from having this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted advertisements, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</li>

If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.

However, you may change your mind and opt back in to Personal Information sales at any time by contacting YDesign at the email address or phone number provided in this notice.</p>
