        We primarily define our Services as those of a personal fitness trainer: Based on your own self-defined training goals, we prepare your personal training and nutritional plan with workouts, suggested recipes and a broad variety of other information about health, fitness and nutrition. To do this, we collect the information required to
        <strong>
            conclude, perform or terminate an agreement
        </strong>
        . This includes:

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The legal basis for this is Art. 6(1) a) and b) and Art. 9(2) a) of the GDPR. Unless we use your contact information for customer support or customer service (see details under Section 3.3), the information required to conclude the agreement is stored until it is no longer needed for this purpose and/or until the rights under any guarantee or warranty expire. Subsequently, we retain the required personal information for the periods established by law. During this retention period (usually six to 10 years after conclusion of the agreement), the information is used only in the case of an audit by the tax authority.

    </h3>
    <p>
        To set up, continuously improve, and track the conversion of our Pinterest campaigns as required, in compliance with Art. 6(1) f) of the GDPR, we use a Pinterest Tag, an individual code snippet, from Pinterest Inc., 635 High Street, Palo Alto, CA, USA, (hereinafter “Pinterest”), which is integrated in our website. This helps us ensure that the Pinterest ads we initiate are only displayed to Pinterest users who have shown interest in our Services. In this way we know that our Pinterest ads correspond to the potential interest of the respective users and not bothering them. It also allows us to track the actions of Pinterest users after they have viewed or clicked on one of our Pinterest ads. At the same time, it helps us track the conversion of the respective campaign for statistical, market-research and billing purposes. The following information is collected during its use:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Device information (e.g. type, brand)
        </li>

        Information collected in this way is anonymous to us and therefore does not provide us with any information about the identity of the respective user. Such processing for behavioural and interest-based advertising purposes is recognized as in our legitimate interest under Recital 47 of the GDPR. The data is stored in accordance with the legally established retention periods and then automatically deleted.

Access to the personal information of our customers is only possible for those employees who need them to carry out their activities.

        All personal data sent by you, including your payment information, is also transmitted using the generally accepted and secure SSL (Secure Socket Layer) standard. SSL is a secure and proven standard, e.g. it is also used for online banking. You will recognize a secure SSL connection with the placement of an “s” at the end of http (i.e. https: // ...) in the address bar of your browser, or with the lock icon at the bottom of the browser.

    </p>
    <p>
        In the event that personal data is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal data has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
