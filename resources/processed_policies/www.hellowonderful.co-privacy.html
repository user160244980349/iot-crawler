    <p>
        Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” and server logs to collect information about how our site is used.

        A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

These pixels allow social media sites to track visitors to outside websites so as to tailor advertising messages users see while visiting that social media website.
