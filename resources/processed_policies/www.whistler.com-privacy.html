        We work with Arrivalist to place cookies on your devices and collect the IP address of your devices, which provides Arrivalist with your general location data. Arrivalist uses this data to report to us on an aggregated basis on the effectiveness of our advertisements at inspiring tourists to travel to Whistler and to provide us with statistics on visitors to Whistler (for instance, where they are coming from). In order to do so, Arrivalist may combine your IP address with other information that they have obtained from other sources, as permitted by law. If you wish to opt out of Arrivalist cookies that allow us to collect aggregate information on arrivals to Whistler click
        <a href="http://dc.arrivalist.com/optout/">
            here

        Advertising Cookies
    </h3>
    <p>
        Cookies are common in online advertising in order to improve the relevancy of the ads you see and while they are not meant to allow us or our advertising partners to gain personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personal information if it allows us to identify you personally. We only work with advertising partners who follow
        <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/">
            industry standards and best practices
        </a>
        . Some of the vendors we work with who process our data are DoubleClick, Sizmek, and Adobe.

        We may use cookies to serve our remarketing campaigns so that advertising vendors, which could include platforms like Google and Facebook, show our ads on sites across the Internet.

    <h2>
        Server Logs
    </h2>
    <p>
        As is true with most websites, our server will automatically log data regarding each visit such as your browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system. We may use this information to monitor server errors, server administration or to monitor visitor behaviour. It is not possible for this to be disabled on a per-user basis so you must leave this website (and the internet entirely) if you do not agree to this happening.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Analytics
    </h2>
    <p>
        Like most websites on the Internet, this site uses Google Analytics to track items such as pages visited, the kind of computer you are using, how you reached our site and time on site. No personal information is uploaded to Google Analytics. All our activity falls within the bounds of the

    </h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease personal information to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Customer information is only used or disclosed for the purpose for which it was collected, unless you, as a customer, have otherwise consented, or when it is required or permitted by law or disclosure is authorized by the Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have booked with Tourism Whistler, we may also use your personal information for direct marketing purposes, unless you choose to opt-out of receiving these offers. On occasion we may use a third party to provide services such as mailing services, some of whom may be located outside of Canada. As a result, these service providers would be provided with the personal information necessary to perform the requested service. Any service provider we use is prohibited from using the information for any purpose other than providing the service Tourism Whistler requests.
