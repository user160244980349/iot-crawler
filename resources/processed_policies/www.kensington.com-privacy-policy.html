    <p>
        Certain links in our emails and third-party websites may include tracking information embedded in the link. This tracking is accomplished via a redirection system that allows us to understand whether you clicked on the link and how the link is being used. In some cases, this non-personal information can be combined with personal information we have about you to improve our services and marketing campaigns.
    </p>
    What information do we collect from third parties?   Chevron Icon

    <h3>
        Customer Lists
    </h3>
    <p>
        To support our marketing efforts, we sometimes collect from third party printers or marketing providers lists of individuals or businesses that may be interested in our products. We use these lists to send marketing communications to relevant individuals. We also use these lists to append additional information to our existing customer lists or to ensure the accuracy of our existing customer lists. For example, we collect information from the U.S. Postal Service National Change of Address service to ensure we have the most up-to-date address information about our customers. These lists can include any of the information mentioned above in the “What information do we collect from you?” section above.
