            2.Information we collect and how we collect it
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The categories of personal information we collect depend on whether you are a customer, user or visitor and the requirements of applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Account Information
        </strong>
        . You can provide information to us through our Services when you register at the Site and/or create a Molekule account. When you create an account, we collect your e-mail address, name, address, and zip code. If you purchase our product, you will also be asked to provide your credit card or bank account information for purposes of processing payments for products, including any subscriptions for filter auto-refills, through the Payment section of our Website. We do not store your payment account information. Our third-party service provider, Stripe, collects and stores your payment information to provide payment processing services initially and through our filter auto-refills subscription services. If you choose to finance your purchase, you can provide credit application information directly to a third-party bank under their terms and privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Product Data
        </strong>
        . The Products may contain sensors that collect certain data about the indoor air quality, such as temperature, humidity, and levels of particulate matter or other pollutants in the air. If you
        <strong>
            connect
        </strong>
        a Product to WiFi, the Product may transmit this indoor air quality data on an ongoing basis to our servers while your Product remains connected and we will retain and process this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We also may collect and maintain information about the filter status for your Product.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Completing Surveys
        </strong>
        . If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information, which may include personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Engaging with Us on Social Media
        </strong>
        . We may offer opportunities to participate in forums, reviews, blogs, or social media pages. Any content you provide on these channels will be considered “public” and may be available to other users and the general public.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Information We Collect Automatically

        <strong>
            Location Information
        </strong>
        . We may collect and store information about your location. For example, when you visit or use our Site or App, we may approximate your location based on your IP address, or we may collect information about your location through GPS, WiFi, wireless network triangulation or other method if you allow the Services to access location services on your device.

            Communications with Us

        <strong>
            Information from Other Sources
        </strong>

We occasionally may receive personal information from our third-party distributors in connection with customer support requests related to Molekule products purchased through these distributors. We may obtain personal information about you from other sources, including through third party services and organizations to supplement information provided by you. For example, if you access our Site, Apps or Products through a third-party application, such as an app store, a third-party login service, or a social networking site, we may collect information about you from that third-party application. The information we receive from these third parties is dependent on the applicable third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third party service, and could include information such as your name, your user identification number, your user name, location, gender, birth date, email, profile picture, and your contacts stored in that service or any other information you permit the third party application to share with third parties. Similarly, if you use a third party login service through a social network or authentication service such as Facebook or Google, these services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share personal information with us, which could include your name, email address or other information. We or our payment processors may also be provided with other information about you from third parties, such as demographic information, credit reference or fraud prevention information, and updated payment information or payment methods related to your purchases of our Products, consistent with applicable law. This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to us and to enhance our ability to provide you with the Services and provide you with information about our business, products, and services.

        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Our Products typically contain one or more filters that should be replaced from time to time as indicated for each Product (“Filters”). The purchase of our Products will typically automatically include a subscription for automatic, recurring purchases and shipment of certain Filters (“Auto-Ship”). Depending on the Product and our offerings, you may have the option of making one-time payments for certain Filters.
    </p>
    <p>
        BY USING AUTO-SHIP, YOU AUTHORIZE US TO INITIATE RECURRING NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENTS AS SET FORTH BELOW. If you use Auto-Ship, we (or our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge you, at the time of each Auto-Ship subscription renewal, using the payment information you have provided until you cancel your Auto-Ship subscription. Your Auto-Ship subscription will automatically renew on a specified cadence, typically every six or twelve months depending on the Product, and your credit card will automatically be charged the full amount for such Filters, plus any applicable taxes, and other charges (“Auto-Ship Fee”) upon renewal at the beginning of each renewal period until cancelled. YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR AUTO-SHIP SUBSCRIPTION AT LEAST ONE DAY PRIOR TO THE RENEWAL DATE TO AVOID THE BILLING OF THE FEES FOR THE NEXT RENEWAL PERIOD. By agreeing to these Terms and using Auto-Ship, you acknowledge that your Auto-Ship subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Auto-Ship subscription. Your Auto-Ship subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or Auto-Ship in accordance with these Terms. You can cancel your Auto-Ship subscription at any time in your account under ‘Options’ or by contacting us at support@molekule.com or toll-free at 1(855) 999-9069 Monday – Friday 9 am – 5 pm PT. Cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current renewal period. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE AUTO-SHIP FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT AUTO-SHIP SHIPMENT AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. If you have any shipments still outstanding in your current renewal period at the time you cancel your Auto-Ship subscription, you will continue to receive those shipments, and you will be responsible for all Auto-Ship Fees incurred for such Auto-Ship shipments, as applicable, but will not be billed for another renewal period thereafter.

Molekule’s policy is to honor product warranties only on products purchased directly from Molekule or from authorized Molekule resellers, and only if accompanied by a receipt or proof of purchase. A list of Molekule’s authorized resellers is available on Molekule’s website. If you purchase a Molekule product from an unauthorized dealer or if the original factory serial number has been removed, defaced or altered, your Molekule product warranty will be deemed invalid.

        Molekule’s sole obligation under this warranty will be at its option to repair or replace the Product and the replaced Product will be warranted for the remaining period of the original warranty. Replacement Products may contain new or refurbished parts. This warranty does not apply to Products damaged by misuse, accident, electrical disturbance or normal wear and tear. The Product is not designed for or warranted against damage from use in areas subject to extreme temperature, excessive moisture, or other inherently hazardous environments.

EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, MOLEKULE DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS.

            You and Molekule agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”).
        </em>
        Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide Molekule with written notice of your desire to do so by regular mail at Molekule, Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 1301 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94103 within thirty (30) days following the date you first access the Services (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you don’t provide Molekule with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Molekule with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Molekule with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice,
        <em>
            you acknowledge and agree that you and Molekule
        </em>
        are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Molekule otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.

    <p>
        <em>
            The arbitration will be administered by
        </em>
        the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
        <em>
            in accordance with the
        </em>
        Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at
        <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">
            www.adr.org/arb_med
        </a>
        or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>
            Arbitration Process
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general
        <a href="http://wikis.fenwick.com/sites/licensewiki/Shared%20Documents/Practice%20Tools%20and%20Documents/AAA%20commercial%20demand%20.pdf">
            Demand for Arbitration

        and a separate

            Demand for Arbitration for California residents
        </a>
        .) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>
            Arbitration Location and Procedure
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Unless you and Molekule otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Molekule submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>
            Arbitrator’s Decision
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Molekule will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>
            Fees
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Molekule will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

    <h3>
        <strong>
            Changes
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Notwithstanding the provisions describing changes to these Terms above, if Molekule changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accessed the Services (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to www.Molekule.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or, if applicable, in the date of Molekule’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Molekule in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accessed the Services (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

    <h3>
        <strong>
            General Terms
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Molekule and you regarding the Services (including Products and Deals) and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Molekule and you regarding the Services and Content. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the “Arbitration” section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Molekule’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and void. Molekule may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any notices or other communications provided by Molekule under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of sending will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Molekule’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Molekule. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

        Our Products typically contain one or more filters that should be replaced from time to time as indicated for each Product (“Filters”). The purchase of our Products will typically automatically include a subscription for automatic, recurring purchases and shipment of certain Filters (“Auto-Ship”). Depending on the Product and our offerings, you may have the option of making one-time payments for certain Filters.
    </p>
    <p>
        BY USING AUTO-SHIP, YOU AUTHORIZE US TO INITIATE RECURRING NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENTS AS SET FORTH BELOW. If you use Auto-Ship, we (or our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge you, at the time of each Auto-Ship subscription renewal, using the payment information you have provided until you cancel your Auto-Ship subscription. Your Auto-Ship subscription will automatically renew on a specified cadence, typically every six or twelve months depending on the Product, and your credit card will automatically be charged the full amount for such Filters, plus any applicable taxes, and other charges (“Auto-Ship Fee”) upon renewal at the beginning of each renewal period until cancelled. YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR AUTO-SHIP SUBSCRIPTION AT LEAST ONE DAY PRIOR TO THE RENEWAL DATE TO AVOID THE BILLING OF THE FEES FOR THE NEXT RENEWAL PERIOD. By agreeing to these Terms and using Auto-Ship, you acknowledge that your Auto-Ship subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Auto-Ship subscription. Your Auto-Ship subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or Auto-Ship in accordance with these Terms. You can cancel your Auto-Ship subscription at any time in your account under ‘Options’ or by contacting us at support@molekule.com or toll-free at 1(855) 999-9069 Monday – Friday 9 am – 5 pm PT. Cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current renewal period. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE AUTO-SHIP FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT AUTO-SHIP SHIPMENT AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. If you have any shipments still outstanding in your current renewal period at the time you cancel your Auto-Ship subscription, you will continue to receive those shipments, and you will be responsible for all Auto-Ship Fees incurred for such Auto-Ship shipments, as applicable, but will not be billed for another renewal period thereafter.
