        You are free not to provide such personal data, but should be aware that failure to provide such data will prevent us from negotiating or executing the contract.

    </p>

            5. Who is receiving your personal data?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We only share your personal data in line with this Policy, and therefore mainly with our employees across different departments and, possibly, other entities of the Somfy Group, only for the following purposes: customer management, central administration of customer and supplier relationships, and for the purpose of streamlining Somfy’s business operations. This sharing of personal data is carried out on the basis of Somfy Group’s legitimate interest to administer its contractual relations within the Somfy Group and maintain an effective business structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where we share your personal data with third parties as outlined in this Policy (e.g. for shipments, financial transactions, software services), we ensure that such third party provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            6. How your personal data is protected?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We put in place a series of technical and organisational measures to secure your personal data and to protect it from unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or access.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our staff, agents and sub-contractors processing your personal data have signed a confidentiality agreement, or are otherwise bound to a duty of confidentiality, or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
    </p>
    <p>
        We impose strict security obligations also on any third-party service provider who handles your personal data in line with this Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            7. Data retention
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary for each of the purposes outlined above.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may however retain certain of your personal data for compliance with applicable laws and regulations (e.g. for tax and audit purposes) and in accordance with our internal data retention rules.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where it is no longer required to retain data that can still identify you, we will either erase, anonymise or aggregate it so that you may no longer be identifiable as a single individual.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            8. International data transfers
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We store and process your personal data mainly on servers located in the EU/EEA or Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, we operate as a global company and rely on international service providers to support our global solutions. Your personal data may be transferred to another country other than the one you reside in.
    </p>
    <p>
