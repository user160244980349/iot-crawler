We may limit your individual rights requests in the following ways: (a) where denial of access is required or authorized by law; (b) when granting access would have a negative impact on other's privacy; (c) to protect our rights and properties; and (d) where the request is frivolous or burdensome.</p>
<p>If you would like to exercise your rights under applicable law, please contact us at <u><a href="mailto:privacy@idealindustries.com">privacy@idealindustries.com</a></u>. Please note, we may seek to verify your identity when we receive an individual rights request from you in order to ensure the security of your personal information. When we fulfill your individual rights requests for correct (or rectification), erasure or restriction of processing, we will notify third parties also handling the relevant personal information unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.</p>

<p><u>Complaints</u></p>
<p>If you believe that we have infringed or violated your rights under this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <u><a href="mailto:privacy@idealindustries.com">privacy@idealindustries.com </a></u>so that we can work with you to resolve your concerns. You can also complain about our processing of your personal information to the relevant data protection authority where you live or work, or in the place where the alleged breach of data protection law has taken place.</p>
<p><u>International Transfers of Personal Information</u></p>
<p>We may store, process and transmit personal information in locations around the world, including locations outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located.
