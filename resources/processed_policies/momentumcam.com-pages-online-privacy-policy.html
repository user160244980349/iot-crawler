        We’ve compiled this privacy policy to be transparent about how we collect, store, use, protect, and otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

            How do we use PII?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We use PII to help us serve you better and process your transactions
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            How do we protect PII?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our website is regularly scanned for security holes, malware and other vulnerabilities. Your PII is contained within secured networks and is only viewable by a limited number of persons who have special access to these networks. These people are required to keep PII confidential. All sensitive information, including credit information, is encrypted. All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored on our servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            What PII do we disclose to third parties?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We
        <em>
            do not
        </em>
        sell, trade or otherwise share your PII. We do not allow third party behavioral tracking. Additionally, we do not include or offer third party products or services on our website.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Links to other Websites
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain links on our website will take you to other websites not under our control. We provide these links as a convenience, and their inclusion is not an endorsement by us. These websites may have different privacy policies than we do and use information you provide according to their own standards and practices. Also, these websites may change their content, operations and policies at their own discretion. You acknowledge that when you click on a link that leaves our website that we are not responsible for those websites or their use of information you provide. Accordingly, we suggest you review and consider the privacy and other policy statements on these websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            How does our website handle “do not track” signals?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We honor “do not track” signals and do not track, plant cookies or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Cookies
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We, along with third-party vendors such as Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding our website’s use and usefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are concerned about receiving cookies from websites, you can set your browser to disable this feature or to notify you when they are sent. Disabling the reception of cookies may limit your access to portions of our website.

        <strong>
            Fair Information Practices
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Fair Information Practices principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States, and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding Fair Information Practice principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach occur, we will notify users via email within seven (7) business days. We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

        <strong>
            CalOPPA (California Online Privacy Protection Act)
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting PII from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at:

        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users may visit our website anonymously;
        </li>
        <li>
            We have added a conspicuous link to this Privacy Policy on our home page (or on the first significant page after entering our website).
        </li>
        <li>
            Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can be easily be found on our website;
        </li>
        <li>
            Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy page; and
        </li>
        <li>
            Users are able to change their PII by emailing or calling us.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to the collection of PII from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under 13.

    <p>
        <strong>
            CAN-SPAM Act
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            We collect your email address to:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders;
        </li>
        <li>
            We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service; and
        </li>
        <li>
            Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our customers after the original transaction has occurred.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            To comply with CAN-SPAM we agree to:

        <li>
            Not use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses;

        </li>
        <li>
            Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly; and
        </li>
        <li>
            Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at or near the bottom of each email.
