    <h2>
        Children
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you are a child who is using our Digital Products or a parent of a child using our Digital Products, there are additional rules
    </p>
    <p>
        Learn more:
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to us that children can enjoy the Site and our Digital Products in a responsible fashion. We encourage parents and guardians to supervise their children’s online activities by, for example, adopting parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your child’s privacy is important to us. We are committed to safeguarding children’s personal information collected online, and to helping parents and guardians and their children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are aged 15 or under, we will require permission from your parent or guardian in order for you to register on our website, unless otherwise stated at the point of registration. If you are required to provide permission from your parent or guardian, you will be asked to supply the name and email address of a parent or guardian to whom a confirmation email will be sent. Your account will only become active once your parent or guardian has clicked on the link within the confirmation email to provide their consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are a parent or guardian and would like to review any personal information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child’s personal information or if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or practices, you may contact us at info@bbqdragon.com.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Security
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have security protocols in place to protect your Information from unauthorised access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification, and unlawful destruction or accidental loss. We only allow access to our databases when necessary, and then under strict guidelines as to what use may be made of such data.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Where we store your Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        We may use service providers to help us run our Digital Products (or services available on our Digital Products). If we or our service providers transfer any Information out of the European Economic Area (EEA), it will only be done with the relevant protection (under UK law) being in place.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Marketing and Unsubscribing
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you wish to unsubscribe from the list please click on the unsubscribe link in the relevant email or e-mail us at info@bbqdragon.com. Except as to the extent you consent to us doing so under this Privacy Policy, we will not share, license or sell these e-mail addresses without your express consent.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Your Rights in relation to your data
    </h2>
    <p>
        You have rights to access, correct, delete your information or to object to or restrict our processing of it in certain situations. No fee is usually required to exercise these rights, but we may need certain information from you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In certain circumstances, you have the right to:
    </p>
    <p>
        • Request access to your personal information. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        • Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
        • Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
        • Object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes or where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. Generally, other than in relation to marketing, our processing of your personal data is in order to allow us to provide you a service, so we will be unable to provide the service to you without processing your personal data
    </p>
    <p>
        • Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        We allow you to access, correct and edit your details in the “Account” section of bbqdragon.com. If you require any further help from us in relation to the above rights, please email info@bbqdragon.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        No fee is usually required – You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
        What we may need from you – We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Changes to our Privacy Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
        Privacy laws and practice are constantly developing. Our policies and procedures are therefore under continual review. We may, from time to time, update our privacy policy. Any such changes will be posted on this page. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to the Privacy Policy.
