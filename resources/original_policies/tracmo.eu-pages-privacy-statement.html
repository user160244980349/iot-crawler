Concurrent, you also acknowledge that we have the right to update and/or change the Privacy Policy at any time. If there is any new update and/or change in the Privacy Policy, we will post a new version on CubiTag website at cubitag.com (the “Site”). Concurrent, we will also notify you about significant changes in the way we treat your personal information by sending a notice to the then-current e-mail address stored in your CubiTag account or by placing a prominent notice on the Site. Your continued use of the Services after the update and/or change will signify your consent of any adjustment to the Privacy Policy. You are therefore advised to re-read this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. If you object to any of the changes to this Privacy Policy, you must cease using the Services and may request us to erase your Personal Information.</p>
<p>We collect your Personal Information when you create a new CubiTag account, when you use our Product and Services, when you visit our pages or the pages of our partners, and when you use Internet access through our partners. We automatically receive and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, device information, device measured temperature, and the content page you requested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information related to CubiTag Services &amp; Product</strong></p>
<p>To complete the order from the Site, you need to provide an email address, a first and last name, a shipping address, a phone number, and a payment information, such as your credit card or payment account information. Your payment information is needed to process your order and is not stored on CubiTag server.</p>
<p>To use CubiTag Services, you need to create a CubiTag account where your valid email address and created password are collected &amp; stored for your use of the Services. We do not identify you personally to other users or make your account information available to any third party in any way that could identify you without your prior consent.</p>
<p>When you activate a CubiTag device using the CubiTag app, that CubiTag’s unique identifier (or CubiTag ID) will be associated with your account. If you choose to name your CubiTag or add a photo of it, this information will also be associated with your account. The main purpose of CubiTag is to help you to find or locate where your items are. Therefore, it’s necessary to collect information about your device (e.g. smartphone) location information and your CubiTag device’s location information (the “Location Information”). By naming a location, you agree that CubiTag can share the location name anonymously to other users. This information will be used to make it easier for you and other users to understand the Location Information.</p>
<p>While the app is running on your device, it periodically transmits your Location Information. This allows CubiTag to show you, on your map, the last place your CubiTag device was seen by your device or the location history of your CubiTag. We may also collect and update Location Information of your CubiTag device anonymously from other CubiTag users who are running the App within Bluetooth range of your CubiTag device. In like manner, we may also collect location information about other CubiTag users’ device, tracked and transmitted to us by the App on your device. Any Location Information we receive will be stored on CubiTag cloud server. We do this to provide you and other CubiTag users with the most recent and accurate location of CubiTag device, even if they are out of the devices’ Bluetooth range.</p>
<p>The Location Information associated with your CubiTag device is never made available to other CubiTag users. Unless you actively decide to share your Location Information through the Services. For example, by choosing to share your CubiTag device with another CubiTag user, or by using Social Networks. CubiTag will not identify you personally to other CubiTag users or otherwise make your Location Information available to any third party in personal identifiable form without your prior consent.</p>
<p>In addition, information that your mobile device sends when you use the Services, such as your device’s model, operating system type and version, and the dates and times of your requests, and any Personal Information that you provide to our customer support team via live chat, email request submission, or direct email are also collected by us.</p>
<p>We may use and process your Personal Information, including your Location Information: (i) to fulfill your requests for your use of the Services; (ii) to provide you with support and handle requests and complaints; (iii) to send you updates, notices, offers, and additional information related to the Services; (iv) to create an anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on the Services, in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to users of the Services, to our service providers or business partners; (v) to properly operate the Services; (vi) to improve the quality of the Services; (vii) to enhance your experience; (viii) to create new services and features, including customized services; (ix) to change or cancel existing content or service; (x) for further internal, commercial, research, anonymous reporting for internal and external clients, and statistical purposes.</p>
