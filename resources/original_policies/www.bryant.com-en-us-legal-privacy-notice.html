<p>Your mobile or internet service providers may have a conflicting privacy notice or policy that permits them to capture, use and/or retain your Personal Information when you visit the Websites or use the Apps, but Bryant is not responsible for and does not control how other parties may collect your Personal Information when you access the Websites or Apps.</p>
<h2>WHY DOES BRYANT COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

<p>If we collect other information for a specific form, feature, or other service that you may use or request, we will use the information for a purpose or purposes relevant to the particular form, feature or service. For information you provide, you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to provide it. If you choose not to provide any of the Personal Information requested, Bryant may be unable to complete your transaction, or provide the information, services or products you have requested. For information that is automatically collected, you can choose not to visit our Websites or use our Apps or Connected Products.</p>

<p>You may not impersonate someone else (e.g., adopt the identity of a celebrity or your next-door neighbor) or create a review for anyone other than yourself. You alone are responsible for any material you may submit via our Websites (“Your Content”), and once published, it cannot always be withdrawn. You assume all risks associated with Your Content, including anyone’s reliance on its quality, accuracy, or reliability, or any disclosure by you of information in Your Content that makes you personally identifiable. You represent that you own, or have the necessary permissions to use and authorize the use of Your Content as described herein. You may not imply that Your Content is in any way sponsored or endorsed by Bryant. You may expose yourself to liability if, for example, Your Content contains material that is false, intentionally misleading, or defamatory; violates any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; contains material that is unlawful, including illegal hate speech or pornography; exploits or otherwise harms minors; or violates or advocates the violation of any law or regulation. Content submitted by others (including any that may have been created by users employed or contracted by Bryant) does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bryant. We reserve the right to remove, screen, edit, or reinstate such content from time to time at our sole discretion for any reason or no reason, and without notice to you. For example, we may remove a review if we believe it violates the General Review Guidelines below. We have no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of Your Content, nor do we guarantee any confidentiality with respect to Your Content. We may use Your Content in a number of different ways, including publicly displaying it, reformatting it, incorporating it into advertisements and other works (including social media), creating derivative works from it, promoting it, distributing it, and allowing others to do the same in connection with their own websites and media platforms (“Other Media”).

<h3>General Review Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inappropriate content: Threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and other displays of bigotry are not permitted.</li>
<li>Conflicts of interest: Your contributions should be unbiased and objective. For example, you shouldn’t write reviews of your own business or employer, your friends’ or relatives’ business, your peers or competitors in your industry, or businesses in your networking group.

<li>Promotional content: Unless you are using your business account to add content to your business’s profile page, you shouldn’t submit promotional content.</li>

Please don’t post close-up photos or videos of other individuals without their permission, and please don’t post other people’s full names unless you’re referring to service providers who are commonly identified by or commonly share their own full names.</li>
<li>Intellectual property: All content must be your own.</li>
<li>Demanding payment: Beyond simply asking for a refund to remedy a bad experience, you should not use removing or posting your review as a way to extract payment from a business, regardless of whether you’ve been a customer.</li>

<h2>HOW DOES BRYANT USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>Bryant may use cookies on this Website. &nbsp;Cookies are small text files sent to and stored on users’ computers. We use cookies to allow the Website to recognize repeat users, facilitate users’ access to the Website, and allow the Website to compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements. &nbsp;Cookies do not damage users’ computers or files. &nbsp;If you do not want cookies to be accessible by this or any other Bryant Website, you should adjust the settings on your browser program to deny or disable the use of cookies. However, denying or disabling cookies or similar technology may prevent you from accessing some of our content or using some of the features on the Website. Bryant may also use cookies and similar technology placed by one of our business or advertising partners to enable Bryant to learn which advertisements bring users to our Website.</p>
<p>In addition, Bryant monitors user traffic patterns throughout its Websites according to a user's domain name, browser type, date and time of access, pages viewed and other Website interactions. Our Web servers collect the domain names but not the email addresses of visitors. This information is collected in order to measure the number of visitors to our Website and to determine which areas of the Website users find useful based upon the amount of traffic to particular areas and other interactions with the Website.

Web beacons are used in combination with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cookie.html">cookies</a>, which means that, if you turn off your browser's cookies, the web beacons will not be able to track your activity. The web beacon will still count as a website visit, but your unique information will not be recorded.</p>

<ul>
<li>Advertising and email auditing, and reporting;</li>
<li>Personalization;</li>

<li>Unique visitor counts.</li>
</ul>
