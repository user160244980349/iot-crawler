    YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
    <p>
        If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) (Civil Code Section 1798.100, et seq.) may provide Consumers with specific rights regarding your personal information. These may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Information about Collection, Sale or Disclosure: You have the right to be informed of the categories of personal information that we collect about you, the categories of sources from which the personal information was collected, the business or commercial purposes for which the personal information is used, disclosed, or sold, and the categories of third parties with whom we share the personal information, as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Access to Specific Information: You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve months. Once we have verified your identity, we will disclose the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you, which will be made in writing and delivered through your account with us, if you maintain such an account. If you do not maintain an account with CGI, we will provide such information electronically, at your option, in a readily useable format that allows you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deletion Request Rights: You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

                web form.
            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>
