<p>This Privacy Policy governs all websites and mobile applications owned or operated by Coway USA Inc.&nbsp;and its affiliated companies<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>(“Company” or “we” or “us”)<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and any other services, applications, interactive features, social media, and resources offered by us through Internet websites, mobile devices or other devices or platforms (all of which are collectively referred to as the “<strong>Services</strong>”).&nbsp; Your privacy is important to us, and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and protect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information (each, as defined below) when you use the Services and your choices for managing your information preferences. By using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</p>
<p><strong>Information You Choose to Submit</strong></p>
<p>We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, telephone number, billing and shipping address, credit card number, and other payment information, email address and other data that can be reasonably linked to such information<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>(“Personal Information”)<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>only if you choose to share such information with us. For example, you will be required to provide us with certain Personal Information to register with the Services and purchase products. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you decide not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Services, including, without limitation, making purchases. You may review, correct, update, or change your Personal Information, or remove your Personal Information from our direct marketing efforts, at any time by visiting your profile or account page in the Services, or by contacting us at:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>4221 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 210, Los Angeles, CA 90010, Telephone 1-800-285-0982, Fax 1-323-556-8468, info@cowaymega.com</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, except for aggregate information that we may share with third parties in a manner that does not link such information to any individual, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, unless you have given us permission to do so.&nbsp; If, after providing consent, you want to opt out of having your Personal Information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please let us know by sending us an e-mail at info@cowaymega.com or by writing to us at<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Coway USA Inc., 4221 Wilshire Blvd., #210</strong><strong>, Los Angeles, CA 90010<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Attn: Customer Service – Privacy</strong>.&nbsp; Please be sure to include your full name, your name, the e-mail address you used to sign up with for the Services and your mailing address and specifically state that you do not want your personal information shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Automatically Collect</strong></p>
<p>We automatically collect information that does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable user<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>(“Non-Personal Information”)<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>to help us understand how our users use the Services. Like most websites, we automatically collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files may include the IP address of the computer or server that you are using to access the Services, the IP address and/or the URL from the website you visited just before you visited our Site, the URL of the page you visit upon leaving the Services, if any, and the type of browser and operating system and device you are using. This anonymous usage information may be associated with your username and profile, but we will not disclose the associated information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>We may use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your web browser) and web beacons (an electronic file placed within a website that monitors usage). We may use cookies and web beacons to improve the quality of the Services. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Certain of our Service Providers (defined below) may use cookies and web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf, including, without limitation, targeted ad serving.</p>
<p>We may work with third-party advertising companies, which may use information about your visit to the Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you on the Services and/or on third-party websites. From the Services, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party advertisement serving company may collect from you. For more information about ad cookies and companies that provide users the ability to “opt-out” of the collection of information from such cookies, please click here.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track</strong></p>
<p>Our Websites will not respond to web browser “do not track” signals that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time. Our mobile application will not respond to such signals.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We may use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to process and fulfill your orders, to communicate with you regarding your orders and deliveries, to notify you of new products or services, to send service notifications, to customize the advertising and content you see, to improve the Services, to conduct research, to solicit your feedback and input about the Services, and to provide more relevant products, services, and advertisements and relevant information useful for customers on or through the Services. Such information may be combined with data collected from other sources so that we may further improve the relevance of products, services, and advertisements offered on or through the Services.</p>
<p><strong>How We Share Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, except for aggregate information that we may share with third parties in a manner that does not link such information to any individual, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties, unless you have given us permission to do so.</p>
<p><u>Single-Sign-On Services</u>.&nbsp; We offer a single-sign-on service with certain third-party applications and services with whom we have a trusted relationship.&nbsp; The single-sign-on allows you to access and use the third-party applications using your Coway account information.&nbsp; In order to enable the single-sign-on service, we share personal information with the third-party providers of these applications and services.&nbsp; These third-party providers agree with us to use such personal information solely for the purpose of enabling the single-sign-on and agree not to use or disclose such personal information for any other purposes.&nbsp; They also agree to implement and maintain security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.</p>
<p><u>Service Providers</u>.&nbsp; From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>(“Service Providers”)</strong>. For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services on our behalf, such as production and fulfillment, payment processing, hosting and maintenance, data storage and management services, and marketing and promotions. We provide our Service Providers with the information reasonably necessary for them to perform these services, which information may include certain Personal Information such as your name and email address. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.</p>
