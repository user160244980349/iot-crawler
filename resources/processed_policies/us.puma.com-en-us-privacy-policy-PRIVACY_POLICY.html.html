        We may provide your information to our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as to our partners, vendors, distributors, and suppliers, some of which may be outside the United States.

For example, service providers may handle web hosting, credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management.

    <p>
        You may also choose to share certain information.

In order to participate in certain features, you may have to adjust your privacy settings and share additional information.
