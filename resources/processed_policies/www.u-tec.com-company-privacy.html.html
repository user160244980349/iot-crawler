        <li>
            U-tec’s Products use a unique encryption algorithm to decompose finger scan image data to create template data that is then used to trigger the Product’s locking mechanism, this data cannot be reversed to a fingerprint image and cannot be used by a third party. U-tec Products do not capture, collect, obtain, or record users’ fingerprints and no information stored within the Products are transmitted outside the Products and will never be shared to any third party.
        </li>
        <li>
            Certain legislative bodies have enacted laws governing the commercial use of biometric-facilitated transactions. Although U-tec does not perform or control the collection of such data, customers who use U-tec Products including for commercial transactions may be responsible for adhering to those laws.

        <li>
            You acknowledge and agree that any notice, disclosure, consent, or other obligations that may be applicable to the use of U-tec Products under laws governing biometric-facilitated transactions are your responsibility, not that of U-tec; You further agree to release and hold harmless U-tec from any liability associated with any notice, disclosure, consent, or other obligation that may be applicable to the Products with respect to alleged biometric identifiers and biometric information.
