You may review and modify this information through your account settings at any time. We also collect other information that does not personally identify you, such as those relating to your product interests, personal preferences, and deal offers. When you provide personal information through Kala, the information may be sent to servers located in other countries around the world.

    <strong>
        COMMUNICATIONS
    </strong>
    <p>
        We hate getting spam as much as you do – in fact it’s one of the reasons we created Kala. From time to time, however, we may need to contact you with information, announcements and updates, or support requests about your account or orders. Examples of such messages include order confirmations, customer support requests and follow ups, shipping notifications, and policy changes. These messages are typically delivered by email, text, or other push notification. Every account is required to maintain a valid email address with kala to ensure you receive these messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may elect to opt-out of ongoing communications from us, such as offers, newsletters, subscriptions, account information, promotional materials, contest results, survey inquiries, etc. by using a simple “opt out” procedure within Kala’s “My Account” page. You may choose to subscribe to some types of messages, and may choose to unsubscribe from others at any time. However, if you opt-out of receiving our announcements and updates about your account, you may no longer have access to areas restricted to account members. If you wish to opt out of receiving offers directly from our Business Partners, you may opt-out by following the instructions in the emails that they send you.
    </p>
    <strong>
        YOUR CHOICES &amp; CONTROL
    </strong>
    <p>
        We know that our members should have control over their own information, which is why Kala gives you the choice of providing, editing or removing certain information, as well as options about how you’re contacted. You may change or update your account information through your account settings, and may also remove certain optional information that you no longer wish to be publicly visible through Kala.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kala may send communications to you about our services or your activity, some of which are required, service-related notification for members such as transactional messages or legal notices. Other communications, such as newsletters and product review reminders, are not required. You can control whether you receive these optional messages by modifying your notification options in your “my account” page.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you no longer wish to use the Services or receive service-related messages, then you may elect to close your account.
    </p>
    <strong>
        SHARING &amp; DISCLOSURE
    </strong>
    <p>
        While Kala is committed to protecting your personal privacy, there are certain occasions where we (or our Vendors on our behalf) may share information collected about you, or the results or our evaluation and analysis of such information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            As required or permitted by law:
        </li>
        <li>
            With our Vendors to provide services for us and who are required to protect your information;
        </li>
        <li>
            With Business Partners to 1) facilitate a direct relationship with you, including in connection with any program we administer on behalf of the Business Partner, and 2) to enable electronic communications with you as part of purchase, offer, contest, program, or other activity in which you have elected to participate;
        </li>
        <li>
            With a purchaser of Triliant (or its assets);
        </li>
        <li>
            To comply with legal orders and government requests, or as needed to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions;
        </li>
        <li>
            To combat fraud or criminal activity, and to protect our rights or those of our Affiliates, users, and Business Partners, or as part of legal proceedings affecting Triliant;
        </li>
        <li>
            In response to a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate; or
        </li>
        <li>
            With your consent.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We encourage Business Partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, their use of your information obtained through Kala is governed by their privacy policies and is not subject to our control.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may share aggregated, non-personal information in any of the above situations and also with advertisers and others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you post information about yourself or others, or communicate with others using our website, please note that we cannot always control who reads your postings or what they do with the information you provide. We encourage you to use caution in posting personal information.
    </p>
    <strong>
        CHILDREN
    </strong>
    <p>
        Kala is not intended for use by people under the age of 18, nor do we knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18. We do not intentionally orient Kala toward children or target them as an audience, nor are we able to necessarily screen them from using Kala. Some material on Kala may be intended for mature audiences, and parents and guardians should take responsibility for monitoring their children’s use. Kala does not collect or distribute information indicating whether a user is a child.
    </p>
    <strong>
        SECURITY
    </strong>
    <p>
        Kala works hard to protect the security of your personal information and prevent unauthorized access to our systems and to your account. In order to further limit access and provide more robust security, your credit card information is securely stored with our payment provider, displaying only the last four digits of your credit card numbers in Kala during the checkout process and in your account management page.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also important for you as a user to protect against any unauthorized access to your account. When not using Kala, please be sure to sign out especially when using a public or shared device, and ensure that you create a strong password to better protect your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because we do not control the security of the Internet or other networks you use to access Kala or communicate with us, we can’t be, and are not responsible for, the security of information that you choose to communicate with Kala and the Site while it is being transmitted. In addition, Kala is not responsible for any data lost during transmission.
    </p>
    <strong>
        PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
    </strong>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to amend or update our Privacy and Data Use policy on occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
        When this does happen, Kala will alert you via email, text or other notification on Kala of any material changes to this policy before those changes become effective. That way, you have the control to determine whether you wish to continue using our services. Your acceptance of the changes may be through your continued use of Kala after the changes become effective.
    </p>
    <strong>
        CONTACT KALA

    <p>
        If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact Kala’s support team by sending an email to privacy@mykala.com. Please be sure to indicate the nature of your question or concern.
