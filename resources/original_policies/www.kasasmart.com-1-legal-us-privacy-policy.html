information, how we use the information we collect, with whom we
disclose such information. By using or accessing our Products and
Services in any matter, you consent to the practices and policies
outlined in this Privacy Policy. Your use of our Products and Services
is also subject to our Terms of Use, which incorporates this Policy;

<p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>1.1. Information You Knowingly Provide to Us</p>
<p>We collection information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we
collect information when you register for an online account, update your
online account, make a purchase, register for programs, or participate
in customer research. We also collect information when you use, upload,
post, or share your information on our Products and Services, or through
our Sites.</p>
<p>Information we collect about you may include your name; email address;
street address; mobile, home, and work phone numbers; payment
information; account information (such as user ID, password, Product and
Service preferences, contact preferences, firmware version, IP address,
and MAC address, etc.). You may also provide other information that
potentially could be used to identify you, such as the names and images
that you associate with account users, your locations, devices, scenes,
device configuration details, demographic information, third-party
account credentials, schedules and audio/video recordings. Further, you
may upload, share, or post on our Sites or through our Products or
Services. For example, you may post information in a public space on our
Sites, such as on message boards. As another example, you may choose to
upload, share, or post audio or video content recorded by your Kasa Cam.</p>
<p>1.2. Information We Collect Automatically</p>
<p>We automatically collect information about you when you access or use
our Products and Services. For example, when you connect hardware
devices or third-party services to your account, those hardware devices
may report usage information to the Services and the Services may read,
process, and store this information for the purposes described in this
Privacy Policy. Such information is usually associated with the usage of
the particular hardware device or third-party service, such as when a
motion sensor senses motion. The Services will receive information about
the device activation, as well as the information that you have chosen
to associate with the device or service such as device name, group name,
and location name. The type of the device or service from which
information is received will change the types and quantities of
information that is received.</p>
<p>We also automatically collect browsing and usage information, which may
include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, MAC address, access times,
location, mobile device information, operating system, browser type,
certain demographic information, application information, and other
information associated with how you interact with the pages and
Services.</p>
<p>We and third parties may use cookies, action tags, or similar
technologies on your computer to provide the Services and help collect
data. You may block or delete cookies and control data collection
through your web browser settings. However, adjusting your browser
preferences may impact your experience with the Services. For more
information about cookies and your ability to limit or remove cookies,
please see the Cookies and Similar Technologies section below.</p>
<p>1.3. Information We Receive from Other Sources</p>

third-party service providers which you have integrated into our

from affiliates, partners or others that we use to fulfil our
obligations to you as a customer. You should carefully and diligently
review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third

technologies and cookies from third-parties, such as Google Analytics,
