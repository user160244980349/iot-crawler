If you do not provide the relevant information, you may in certain situations not be able to achieve the specific purpose for a particular scenario. For example, you cannot purchase a Cubot product; our call center cannot reach you and provide you with pre-sales and after-sales service; or you cannot download updated software systems and/or applications.
                </p>
                <p>Here are some of the scenarios where we collect your personal information:</p>

                <p>2.2 Where permitted by law, Cubot shall also obtain data about you from third-party sources.

                <p>2.5 Location information: information from you or other users, including your geographic location, such as the region contained in the account information you have provided; country information displayed by the telecommunications carrier code you use. Some pre-loaded, location service-based apps such as maps, navigation and weather service apps will collect your location information with your consent.</p>
                <p>2.6 When you call our customer service center for assistance, we shall ask for your name, phone number, product information and receiving time, and record your number of calls, date of call, problem encountered and the solution we give to you.</p>
                <p>2.7 If you participate in one of Cubot offline product experience events, we will also ask for information such as your name, gender, email address, and phone number.</p>
                <p>2.8 Your information shared through Cubot Community, such as your personal photos uploaded at a Shot On Cubot event; your thoughts and experiences shared through forums and friends, etc.</p>
                <p>2.9 We may legally obtain information about you from other sources, and combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>
