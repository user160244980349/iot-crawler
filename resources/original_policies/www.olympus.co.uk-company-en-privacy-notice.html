<h3>3.7 Blogging-Function with Comment-Feature/ a MyOlympus Service – Consumer Product Division</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>
On our websites in the MyOlympus community we operate a so-called "weblog" or "blog" with comment function. If you would like to comment on a post, you must enter the text in the “Comment” field. These data are then transmitted to us when the comment is sent and stored by us. We store the following data if you comment on a blog-entry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time and date of sending the comment</li>
</ul>
<p>
The text entered in the "Comment" field and the user name or pseudonym are then visible to third parties under the commented blog post together with the name entered and the date and time of publication. Before sending the comment, we ask for your consent and refer you to this privacy terms. Insofar as the collection and processing of the data is based on your consent, Article 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR is the legal basis. Since the processing of your data is also necessary in order to publish your comment, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR also serves as a legal basis. The processing of further data during the sending process and storage in our system should prevent or at least limit an abuse of the comment function and should guarantee the security of our information technology system. Furthermore, we can only delete your comment at your own request if we can identify you. The legal basis for processing the aforementioned data is therefore also based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
<p>
Your data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. Data collected and processed in the context of the comment function is required as long as the comment is published. Even after deletion or removal of the comment, storage and processing of the data may be necessary if contractual or legal obligations require storage.</p>
<p>
You can revoke the consent given before publication of the comment at any time. In this case we will delete all data collected in connection with the respective comment. This does not apply if statutory retention periods require further storage or processing by us.</p>

Furthermore we are entitled to continued storage if we are unable to assert, exercise or defend legal claims without your data. </p>
<p>

</ul>
<p>

Any further processing in such case is only permissible with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or on grounds of an important public interest of the Union or a Member State. You can revoke your consent given in this connection at any time. You will be notified by us before the restriction is lifted.</p>

<p>
