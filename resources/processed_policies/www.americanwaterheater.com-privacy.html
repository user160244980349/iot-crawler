        Automated Collection of Data
    </h3>
    <p>
        When you use our Services or open our emails, we may obtain certain information by automated means, such as browser cookies, Flash cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, server logs, and other technologies. The information we obtain in this manner may include your device IP address, domain name, identifiers associated with your devices, device and operating system type and characteristics, web browser characteristics, language preferences, clickstream data, your interactions with our Services (such as the web pages you visit, links you click and features you use), the pages that led or referred you to our Services, dates and times of access to our Services, and other information about your use of our Services. We also may receive your device’s precise geolocation and other information related to your location through GPS, Bluetooth, WiFi signals and other technologies for certain purposes listed below, such as to provide you with our Services. Your device may provide you with a notification when the Services attempt to collect your precise geolocation.
    </p>
    <p>
        A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “Flash cookie,” also known as a local shared object, functions like a web cookie to personalize a user’s experience on sites that use Adobe Flash Player. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. We and our third-party service providers may use beacons in emails to help us track response rates, identify when our emails are accessed or forwarded, and for other purposes listed below.
    </p>
    <p>
        These technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it; (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the Services; (3) tailor the Services around your preferences; (4) measure the usability of the Services; (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications; and (6) otherwise manage and enhance the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before placing cookies or similar technologies on your computer. You can stop certain types of cookies from being downloaded on your computer by selecting the appropriate settings on your web browser. Most web browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new browser cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new browser cookie and how to disable existing cookies. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking “help” on your browser’s menu or by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org. Flash cookies typically cannot be controlled, deleted or disabled through your browser settings and instead must be managed through your Adobe Flash Player settings. To manage flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go to the Adobe Flash Player Support page available here. In addition, your mobile device settings may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as Apple and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with app developers and operators such as us. Our Services are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers. Please note that without cookies or other automated tools we used to collect this type of data (such as geolocation data), you may not be able to use all the features of our Services.

        Through our Services and websites, both we and certain third parties may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent for the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes. You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks.

These networks track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, Flash cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, server logs, web beacons and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals’ interests, to track users’ browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users’ online browsing and app usage activities. The information our ad networks may collect includes data about users’ visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our Services and websites and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks.

        We do not sell your personal information as the term “sell” is commonly understood to require an exchange for money. However, the California State Attorney General may issue guidance on whether the use of advertising and analytics cookies on our Website may be considered a “sale” of personal information as the term “sale” is broadly defined in the CCPA to include both monetary and other valuable consideration. Until such guidance has been issued, we continue to consider it a “sale” in order to be as transparent as possible and will comply with the restrictions of the “sale” of this information to the extent technologically feasible. This “sale” would be limited to our use of third-party advertising and analytics cookies and their use in providing you behavioral advertising and their use in understanding how people use and interact with our Services and websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have “sold” the following categories of personal information to the following categories of third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration:
    </p>
    <ul>

            Category F: Internet or other similar network activity (

        To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your Authorized Agent) may set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.

    </p>
    <p>
        Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into the sale of personal information at any time by adjusting your cookie preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. You may be required to provide us with additional contact information so that we may verify your request to opt-in to the sale of your personal information. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.

        You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we have collected or maintained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see
        <em>
            Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights

    </p>
    <p>
        We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you, in addition to other legally permission reasons to deny such request as provided in the CCPA.

    <p>
        Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf (an “Authorized Agent”), may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. The verifiable consumer request must:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Provide sufficient information that allows us to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an Authorized Agent. Before responding to a request, we will verify that the request came from you by comparing the identifying information provided by you in your request with any personal information we maintain about you at that time. To protect the privacy and security of your personal information, we may request additional information from you to help us verify your identity and process your request. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
        </li>
        <li>
            Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We are unable to fulfill your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. With few exceptions, we will only fulfill a request from your Authorized Agent if (a) you grant the Authorized Agent written permission to make a request on your behalf, (b) you or the Authorized Agent provides us notice of that written permission, and (c) we are able to verify your identity in connection with that notice and the request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. Please note that we are not obligated to provide information to a consumer in response to a request more than twice in a twelve (12) month period.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

    </p>
    <p>
        We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we need more time (up to 45 additional days), we will notify you in writing, and provide you with an explanation of the reason for the extension.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance.

        <li>
            Deny you goods or services.
        </li>
        <li>
            Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
