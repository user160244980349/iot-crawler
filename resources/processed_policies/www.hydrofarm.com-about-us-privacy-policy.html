    <p>
        This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online.

    <h3>
        Do we use 'cookies'?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            We use cookies to:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Help remember and process the items in the shopping cart.
        </li>
        <li>
            Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.
        </li>
        <li>
            Keep track of advertisements.
        </li>
        <li>
            Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since every browser is slightly different, look at your browser's help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3>
        Third-Party disclosure
    </h3>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Links and Third-Party Collection
    </h3>
    <p>
        Hydrofarm's sites contain links to other sites that are not owned, maintained, operated, or endorsed by or for Hydrofarm and not subject to the same privacy and other policies. The inclusion of any link to such sites does not imply any recommendation or sponsorship of such sites. You should read the other sites' privacy policies to understand how personal information collected about you is used and protected. Hydrofarm's sites also contain third party technologies that collect non-personally identifiable information from you directly. This includes third-party social media sharing buttons. These third parties might use passive tracking techniques such as cookies or web beacons to collect your information. Hydrofarm does not control these third parties. To learn more about their activities, please visit their websites and privacy policies.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Google
    </h3>
    <p>
        We, along with third-party vendors such as Google, use first-party cookies such as the Google Analytics cookies.
    </p>
    <h3>
        California Online Privacy Protection Act
    </h3>
    <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users can visit our site anonymously.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
        </li>
        <li>
            Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found at https://hydrofarm.com/about-hydrofarm/Privacy-Policy.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            You can change your personal information:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            By emailing us
        </li>
        <li>
            By calling us
        </li>
        <li>
            By logging in to your account
        </li>
        <li>
            By chatting with us or by sending us a support ticket
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?
    </h3>
    <p>
        We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
    </p>
    <h3>
        COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
    </h3>
    <p>
        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, which is the United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Fair Information Practices
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical in order to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We will notify you via email within 7 business days
        </li>
        <li>
            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        CAN-SPAM Act
    </h3>
    <p>
        The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            We collect your email address in order to:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions
        </li>
        <li>
            Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders
        </li>
        <li>
            Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM, we agree to do the following:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses
        </li>
        <li>
            Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way
        </li>
        <li>
            Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters
        </li>
        <li>
            Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used
        </li>
        <li>
            Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly
        </li>
        <li>
            Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email; if at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

        </strong>

            Policy Updates
        </strong>
    </p>
