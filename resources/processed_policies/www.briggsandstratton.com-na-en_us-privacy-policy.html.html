        We may receive information about you from third parties who help us update, expand and analyze our records, and improve our website experience. We do not use this information to identify you individually, but it does reflect some of your activities on the Internet, such as the web sites you visited immediately before visiting the Site or links available at other websites that directed you to the Site. In addition, in order for this Site to enhance its ability to tailor the Site to an individual's preference, we may combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our merchant partners to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a purchase from our merchant partners, the companies collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the Site to our users' preferences.

    <p>
        <strong>
            Do we use cookies?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart, understand and save your preferences for future visits to our Site and compile aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interactions so that we can offer better Site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our Site visitors. These service providers are permitted to use the information collected on our behalf only to help us conduct and improve our business.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies by adjusting your browser settings. Like most websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of our services may not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone or by contacting customer service.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not allow third parties to collect individually identifiable information about you or your online activities at this Site or across different sites over time by using cookies or by any other means.
    </p>

        The Site uses Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. An Internet Service Provider ("ISP") typically assigns a random dynamic IP address at the time of your dial-up. For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, a static IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. We may record the IP addresses of visitors to the Site. While an IP address may reveal your ISP or geographic area, we cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP address. However, we may link IP addresses to personally identifiable information you provide through the Site.
    </p>
    <h3>
        e. Information You Provide To A Third Party
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Site includes links from the Site to, and plug-ins (such as Twitter buttons) from, sites or applications operated by third parties (“Third-Party Sites”). Briggs &amp; Stratton does not control any Third-Party Sites and is not responsible for any information they may collect. The information collection practices of Third-Party Sites are governed by their privacy policies. It is your choice to enter any Third-Party Site. We recommend that you read the privacy policy if you choose to do so. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Site and welcome any feedback about these Third-Party Sites.
    </p>
    <h3>
        f. Data Collected From Product Monitoring Apps
    </h3>
    <p>
        Briggs &amp; Stratton offers Apps that collect and display information about internet-connected Briggs &amp; Stratton products (“Product Monitoring Apps”). For example, Briggs &amp; Stratton might offer a Product Monitoring App that collects information from an internet-connected generator purchased from Briggs &amp; Stratton. If you download a Product Monitoring App and register on that App an internet-connected Briggs &amp; Stratton product that you use or that you have purchased, the Product Monitoring App may collect data about that product, such as usage data. For example, in the case of an internet-connected generator, the App might collect information about how many hours per week the generator runs. If you also provide personal information to the Product Monitoring App, e.g., your name or your address, then the App may link data collected from the product with your personal information. If the data from the product is linked to personal information, we will treat that data as personal information too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some Product Monitoring Apps may collect data about the physical location of your internet-connected Briggs &amp; Stratton products. Briggs &amp; Stratton will not combine location data with personal information without informing you under a separate policy or notice. As such, Briggs &amp; Stratton will not treat location data as personal information unless such location data is combined with personal information or unless required by applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the reasons described below, the purpose for which we collect information through the Product Monitoring Apps is to provide you information about your internet-connected Briggs &amp; Stratton products, and so that we can improve such products and related services. Briggs &amp; Stratton is the sole and exclusive owner of any information it collects, receives or creates relating to its Apps that is not personal information (e.g. such as technical data and analytics data), and it will use, store, process, share and disclose such information for any purposes, subject to applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>
        The details of how a Product Monitoring App handles data may be more specifically described in policies or terms of use specific to that App. If the App or Briggs &amp; Stratton product you are using has a separate privacy policy or terms of use applicable to it, that privacy policy or terms of use shall control over the terms in this Privacy Policy.

        Children’s Online Privacy Protection
    </strong>
    <p>
        We do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our Site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.

            4. How We Protect The Information We Collect
        </strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        We work to secure your personal information from being lost, accessed, used, modified, or disclosed by/to unauthorized persons. During transmission of personal information between you and our Site, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt information you input. During the order process, we reveal only the last four digits of your credit card number when confirming an order. The entire credit card number is, of course, submitted to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, but we do not store your credit card information on our servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees with access to personal information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. After a new policy is added, these employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to enhance protection for our customers' information. Finally, the servers that we use to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure, restricted access area.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to close your browser after you have completed your visit to the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that despite our reasonable efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

        </li>
    </ul>
    iii. How We Will Verify Your Request:
    <p>
        The processes that we follow to verify your identity when you make a request to know or a request to delete are described below. The relevant process depends on how and why the request is submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            1. Requests Through Your Password-Protected Account:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you created a password-protected account with us before the date of your request, we will rely on the fact that your request has been submitted through your account as verification of your identity. We will require that you re-authenticate yourself before we disclose your personal information in response to a request to know and before we delete your personal information in response to a request to delete.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are responsible for protecting the security of your log-in credentials for your account. Please do not share your log-in credentials with anyone. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity on or from your account, we will not respond to a request to know or a request to delete until we have been able to confirm, through further verification procedures, that you made the request.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            2. Requests Other Than Through A Password-Protected Account:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you submit a request by any means other than through a password-protected account that you created before the date of your request, the verification process that we follow will depend on the nature of your request as described below:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Requests To Know Categories Of Personal Information: We will match at least two data points that you provide with your request to know, or in response to our request for verification information, against information about you we already have in our records and that we have determined to be reliable for purposes of verifying your identity. Examples of relevant data points include your mobile phone number, your zip code or information about products or services that you have purchased from us.
        </li>
        <li>
            Requests To Know Specific Pieces Of Personal Information: We will match at least three data points that you provide with your request to know, or in response to our request for verification information, against information that we already have about you in our records and that we have determined to be reliable for purposes of verifying your identity. In addition, we will require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the California consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.
        </li>
        <li>
            Requests To Delete Personal Information: Our process for verifying your identity will depend on the sensitivity (as determined by Briggs &amp; Stratton) of the personal information that you ask us to delete. For less sensitive personal information, we will require a match of two data points as described in Point No. 1, above. For more sensitive personal information, we will require a match of three data points and a signed declaration as described in Point No. 2, above.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        We have implemented the following additional procedures when verifying the identity of requestors:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            If we cannot verify your identity based on the processes described above, we may ask you for additional verification information. If we do so, we will permanently delete the verification information that you provide promptly after we have completed the verification process. We will not use that information for any purpose other than verification.
        </li>
        <li>
            If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty to respond to your request, we will let you know promptly and explain why we cannot verify your identity.
        </li>
    </ol>
    iv. Authorized Agents
    <p>
        You may designate an authorized agent to exercise your right to know or your right to delete by submitting to us a completed “Authorized Agent Designation” form. You can obtain the designation form by contacting us at
        <a href="mailto:pr">
            privacy@basco.com
        </a>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        If an authorized agent submits a request to know or a request to delete on your behalf, the authorized agent must submit with the request either (a) a power of attorney that is valid under California law or (b) a document signed by you that authorizes the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf. In addition, we may ask you to follow the applicable process described above for verifying your identity.
    </p>
    v. Briggs &amp; Stratton’s Non-Discrimination Policy
    <p>
        California consumers have the right not to be subject to discriminatory treatment by Briggs &amp; Stratton for exercising their privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, and Briggs &amp; Stratton will not discriminate on that basis. However, Briggs &amp; Stratton may charge a California consumer a different price or rate or provide a different level or quality of goods or services if the difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the California consumer by the consumer’s personal information. If Briggs &amp; Stratton does so, it will provide consumers with any legally required notice.
