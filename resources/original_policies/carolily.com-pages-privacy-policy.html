<h3><strong>Service:</strong></h3>
<p>Products’ and Services’ Descriptions and Specifications. Carolily Finery attempts to be as accurate as possible when describing products and services on the Service. However, Carolily Finery does not warrant that product or service descriptions or specifications are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.

Despite our best efforts, list and sale prices may be incorrect. We reserve the right to correct, at any time, any pricing errors. If a product or service's correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.</p>

<p>Additional Terms.

These terms are posted on the Service in connection with the applicable service. Any such terms are in addition to these Terms and, in the event of a conflict, prevail over these Terms.

<h2><strong>Transactions and Payments:</strong></h2>
<p>You Agree To Pay Carolily Finery for Purchases on the Service. You agree to pay for the purchases you agree to make through the Service.

If non-payment occurs due to a failed credit card transaction and is not remedied within seven days after we send you notice of non-payment, then we may terminate the applicable purchase.</p>
<p>Pre-Authorization. When you provide a credit card number to pay for a purchase on the Service, we, through our third-party payment processor, may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to a purchase. This pre-authorization will verify the credit card is valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your required payment. These pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge. Please contact your card issuer if you have additional questions regarding when an authorization amount will be removed from your statement.</p>
<p>Third-Party Payment Processors. Carolily Finery currently uses third-party payment processors for electronic commerce. Our payment processors and the payment methods they accept may change without notice.

By using such third-party payment processors, you agree to their terms and conditions of use. Such third parties may charge fees to process payments. We may pay certain fees at our sole discretion. Carolily Finery disclaims all liability with regards to any fees or problems you have with third-party payment processors.</p>
<p>Availability of Certain Forms of Payment. Carolily Finery makes no representations and warranties about the continued availability of any particular form of payment method made available for use with the Service.<br>Timing of Payment. Payment occurs within a reasonable time of the transaction or shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Notice of Failed Payment. If any fee cannot be charged to your credit card for any reason, we may provide you, via phone or email, notice of such non-payment and a link for you to update your payment information. If such non-payment is not remedied within seven days after receiving such notice of non-payment, then we may terminate the applicable subscription.<br>Taxes and Fees. You are responsible for determining and paying the appropriate government taxes, fees, and service charges resulting from a transaction occurring through the Service.
