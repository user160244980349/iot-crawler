        E. How We Share your Personal Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        Giant Tiger does not sell customer Personal Information to any other organization or person for any reason. Giant Tiger will only share or disclose Personal Information to third parties in order to support Giant Tiger’s collection or use of your information for purposes outlined in the section titled How We Use Your Personal Information where we have received your consent, unless otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Services providers and suppliers
    </h3>
    <p>
        Giant Tiger may make your Personal Information available to third party service providers to help us provide you with a better shopping experience and improve our business operations. Where Personal Information is processed by a third party provider, we sign agreements with those providers requiring them to use your Personal Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and with applicable federal and provincial privacy legislation in Canada governing the collection, use and disclosure of your information. Our agreements state that any third party providers processing Personal Information on our behalf may only use that Personal Information for the purposes you have consented to at the time of collection. We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third party providers handle this Personal Information as securely as possible and in compliance with federal and provincial Canadian privacy laws and is kept only for the duration they are providing you with a product or service on our behalf, and for a reasonable time thereafter in the event that you wish to resume service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of our third party providers may be located (or use servers located) outside of Canada and may be required to abide by foreign privacy laws or to disclose Personal Information under the laws of other jurisdictions. When working with such service providers, Giant Tiger continues to require privacy and security safeguards consistent with the expectations of Giant Tiger under Canadian law and this Privacy Policy, in addition to any laws or standards that may apply to specific service providers, enforced through contractual means.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Legal requirements and law enforcement disclosures
    </h3>
    <p>
        We do not disclose any Personal Information to third parties without your consent, unless required by law, legal process, law enforcement investigation or fraud detection and prevention. In limited circumstances, Personal Information may be shared in order to meet our legal requirements and to protect Giant Tiger from any illegal or fraudulent activities, or any activities that put the security or integrity of Giant Tiger operations, websites, stores, employees or customers, at risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, we may need to disclose your Personal Information in order to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including fraud, or to assist government enforcement agencies
        </li>
        <li>
            Enforce this Privacy Policy, investigate and defend Giant Tiger against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our websites
        </li>
        <li>
            Exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of Giant Tiger, our users, employees, agents or others
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information may include your name, contact information, purchase details, payment and shipping information, and information collected through your browser (such as IP address).
    </p>
    <h3>
        Business Transfers or Mergers
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the case of a prospective or completed corporate reorganization, merger, sale of business, transfer or other disposition of all or part of the assets or shares of Giant Tiger (including the proceedings of bankruptcy or insolvency), Personal Information about you and other data as described in this Privacy Policy may be part of the transferred assets and may be shared with the other parties to the transaction by complying with the confidentiality requirements under applicable Canadian legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any third party to which Giant Tiger would transfer or sell its assets will have the right to continue to use your personal and other information, provided that they comply with applicable federal and provincial privacy legislation in Canada governing use and disclosure of your information in such circumstances.
    </p>
    <h2>
        F. Retention of Personal Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        Your Personal Information is retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which it was collected, except where otherwise necessary to comply with legal requirements. We may keep your Personal Information for a reasonable time afterwards in the event that you wish to resume service.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For example, we may retain your login information for a reasonable period of time after you ask us to delete your GT ID account, in the event you wish to restore your account at a later date
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Your Personal Information may be retained for a reasonable period of time to ensure that we honor your requests to access your Personal Information, opt-out of certain communications, for record keeping purposes, and the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the Personal Information is no longer required, Giant Tiger ensures that this Personal Information is securely destroyed or anonymized (so that the information no longer is identifiable as information relating to you). We have strict procedures in place with respect to destroying, deleting or disposing of Personal Information when it is no longer required for the purposes set out in this policy, or by law.
    </p>
    <h2>
        G. How to Access or Correct your Personal Information

    <h2>
        I. Passwords
    </h2>
    <p>
        Giant Tiger uses reasonable and appropriate security safeguards to protect the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of GT ID accounts. You are responsible for the security of your GT ID account and for protecting your password. For example, do not write down or share your GT ID account password with anyone, and do not save your GT ID account information on a shared or public computer. Giant Tiger will not be liable for any losses, damages or expenses arising out of or relating to any unauthorized use of such account or password. If you believe your GT ID account has been compromised, immediately contact our Privacy Office.
    </p>
    <h2>
        J. Payment Information Security
    </h2>
    <p>
        We value the security and privacy of all transactions made with Giant Tiger. We use Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology to protect the security of your payment card information (“PCI”), such as debit and credit card information, as it is transmitted through us to our third party payment providers. All third party payment processors maintain PCI DSS and SOC2 compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you make a purchase, all of your Personal Information is encrypted, including credit and debit card number, name and address. SSL is the industry standard for secure commerce transactions. It prevents your Personal Information from being read by someone else as it travels across the Internet. While we implement the above security measures on our websites, there is always a risk of a breach of security safeguards.
    </p>
    <h2>
        K. Links to Other Websites

            For example, our website contains a link to Giant Tiger’s Facebook page. If you click this link (

                https://www.facebook.com/GiantTiger
            </a>
            ) it will take you away from the Giant Tiger website, to Facebook, where your information may be subject to Facebook’s privacy policies.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please note that the privacy policies applicable to the collection of Personal Information on those other websites may be different from this one and we have no control or responsibility for the privacy practices of third party websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all websites you visit, before you share any Personal Information on a website.

        L. Social Media Plug-Ins
    </h2>

When you click on a social media plug-in protocol link while on our website, such as the “Like” button, a link to our website may appear in the “Likes and Interests” section of your Facebook or other social media profiles.
