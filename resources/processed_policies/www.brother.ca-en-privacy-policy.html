                In order to improve our Site, we may use "cookies" or other tools to track your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to help the website recognize you, including by recalling your specific information and settings, to deliver relevant content and to help ease website navigation.
                <br/>
                We and our service providers may use cookies to customize the user experience (such as setting the preferred language) and serve you content (such as advertisements, promotions, products or key messages) that we believe are relevant to you and your interests, based on your visits to our Site and third party websites. We and our service providers may also use cookies and web-analytics to collect information about your use of the Site and enable us to improve the way it works. We do not have access to or control over the use of cookies or web-analytics by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility companies and service providers.

These service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide these services to Brother Canada and are required to protect your personal information using security measures comparable to those used by Brother Canada. Due to business requirements and as permitted under applicable law, your personal information may be stored or processed outside of Canada by Brother Canada or by one of its third party service providers, including in the United States and Japan, in which case it is subject to the laws of that foreign jurisdiction and may be accessible to that jurisdiction’s government, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies.

            Security Of Your Personal Information
            <p>
                We take steps to protect the security of your personal information by using a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, the file containing your personal information is stored on our servers (or those of our service providers) and access to the file is limited to authorized employees and service providers. Sensitive personal information (such as credit card number) transmitted over the Internet is protected through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption or other technologies. Access to your account is available through a password and a unique customer ID selected by you. Your password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at privacy@brother.ca.
