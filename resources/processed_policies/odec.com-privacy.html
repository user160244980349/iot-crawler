The purpose of this Website Privacy Statement and Policy (“Policy”) is to advise visitors of what information ODEC collects, how it is used, and with whom and for what purpose it may be shared.</p> <h2><strong>Web Log</strong></h2> <p>Use of the Website creates a web log that automatically records basic information about your experience. The web log collects statistical information including the internet domain from which you accessed the Website, your IP address, the type of browser and operating system, date/time of access, pages visited, and links clicked, among other data. This information is gathered in aggregate form, does not individually identify you, and is used to administer and improve the ODEC Website based on visitor’s interests and needs.</p> <h2><strong>Cookies</strong></h2> <p>A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer, through your browser by a web page server. We use this information internally, to gather data which helps us enhance the efficiency and usefulness of the Website. One example is automatic generation of a “recently viewed pages” function for your convenience. Visitors who object should consult their browser’s documents for information on erasing or blocking cookies.</p> <h2><strong>Visitor-Initiated Interactions</strong></h2> <p>We appreciate your interest in the Company and value your feedback. Portions of the Website enable you to interact with ODEC. Data voluntarily provided to us through the Website is stored and used to provide requested services, for internal marketing purposes, and to improve the Website experience.</p> <p>We do not share this information with third parties, except as provided in this Policy. ODEC may share it among Company staff and others, as necessary, to respond to your request. Routine e-mails sent to us through the Website, or otherwise, are not necessarily secure against interception.</p> <h2><strong>Recruitment Services</strong></h2> <p>Website users can search and apply for employment opportunities with ODEC. If you complete an application online, provide a resume or disclose other personal information for recruitment purposes, ODEC will use this information in the same manner as if you applied by regular mail or in person.</p> <p>The Company uses security measures reasonable to the nature and scope of our operations to protect confidential personal information. A third party hosts ODEC’s applicant tracking system. See UltiPro’s Website Privacy Statement for information on its data privacy and security practices. ODEC requires the third party, by contract, to implement reasonable security designed to protect client data from unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or destruction.</p> <p>It is possible that information about you will be shared externally to verify the information, obtain references, or for other employment or recruitment. By submitting an application—whether online or by hardcopy—you consent to ODEC sharing it, as described in this Policy.</p> <h2><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong></h2> <p>This Website may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by ODEC. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites. This Policy applies only to information collected through our Website or in connection with other business purposes. You should carefully review the privacy practices of third party websites.</p> <h2>Changes to the Policy</h2> <p>From time to time, it may be necessary to make changes to this Policy to reflect changes to the Website or other services, technology or legal requirements. ODEC reserves the right to modify the Policy at any time, in any manner, and without prior notice to you.</p> <h2>Children Online Privacy Protection Act and Compliance</h2> <p>The Company is committed to protecting children online and in our business practices. Content on the Website would not be considered harmful to children. In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, ODEC does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 18.</p> <h2><strong>Legal Processes</strong></h2> <p>ODEC may be required to provide any information within its possession, custody or control in a good faith effort to comply with the law, in response to a court order, to defend our rights or property or to respond to an emergency situation. The Company will attempt to notify you upon receipt of such judicial process, if possible.</p> <h2>More Information</h2> <p>Should you have questions regarding this privacy policy, email us at </p>     </body></html>
