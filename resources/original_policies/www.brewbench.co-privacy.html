              <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
              <i>Updated August 31, 2020</i><br><br>
              <p>
                Thanks for using BrewBench.<br><br>
                This policy explains the what, how, and why of the information we collect when you use our Services. It also explains the specific ways we use and disclose that information. We take your privacy extremely seriously, and we never sell lists or email addresses.
              </p>
              <h2>Definitions</h2>
              <p>
                We’ll start with the basics, including a few definitions that should help you understand this policy.
                When we say "we", "us" and “BrewBench”, we're referring to Hopsware LLC. d/b/a BrewBench, a State of Colorado limited liability company.
                We provide online platforms that you may use to monitor and control brew systems and brew sessions.

                <br><br>We offer services on our websites brewbench.co or any subdomain of brewbench.co (we’ll refer to it as the “Website” or "Services")
                that allows you to submit brew system and brew session data including temperature readings and sensor data for
                analytics and diagnostic purposes.  As a customer of the Services or a representative of
                an entity that’s a customer of the Service, you’re a “Member” according to this agreement (or “you”).
              </p>
              <h2>Your Information</h2>
              <p>
                </p><ol>
                  <li><p><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong> When you use the Services, consult with our customer service team, send us an email or communicate with us in any way, you’re giving us information that we collect. That information may include your and your Subscribers’ IP address, name, physical address, email address, phone number, credit card information, operating system, as well as details like gender, occupation, location, birth date, purchase history, and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, transferred to the United States and stored by us, as described in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> and Privacy Policy.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Information You Post to the BrewBench</strong>: When you submit data to the Service we may need to submit pieces of that data to third party services for processing.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Information from your Use of the Service</strong>: We may get information about how and when you use the Services, store it in log files associated with your account, and link it to other information we collect about you. This information may include, for example, your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions you’ve taken within the application.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Cookies and Tracking</strong>: When you use BrewBench, we may store “cookies,” “tags,” or “scripts,” which are strings of code, on your computer. We and our analytics Service Providers (like <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">Google</a>) use those cookies to collect information about your visit and your use of our Website or Services. You may turn off cookies that have been placed on your computer by following the instructions on your browser, but if you block cookies, it may be more difficult (and maybe even impossible) to use some aspects of the Services.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Web Beacons</strong>: When we send emails to Members, we may track behavior such as who opened the emails and who clicked the links. We do that to measure the performance of our email campaigns and to improve our features for specific segments of Members. To do this, we include single pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create the reports about how your email campaign performed and what actions your Subscribers took. Reports are also available to us when we send email to you, so we may collect and review that information.</p></li>
