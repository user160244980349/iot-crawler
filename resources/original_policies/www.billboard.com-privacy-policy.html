</ul>
<h2><a id="share"></a>4. How We Share the Information Collected</h2>
<p>PMC may (and you authorize us to) share or disclose information collected from and about you on the Services to other companies or individuals as set forth below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;We may provide access to information to vendors that are performing services on our behalf, including fulfilling subscriptions to our Publications, processing and fulfilling orders for other goods and services, managing our email lists and sending email messages on our behalf, processing payments, providing customer support, analytics providers, and performing other administrative services, in order to carry out such services.</li>
<li><strong>Our Affiliates.</strong>&nbsp;We may share information we collect within the PMC family of companies to deliver products and services to you, ensure a consistent level of service across our Services, internal management and administrative purposes on our behalf and enhance our products, services, and your customer experience.</li>
<li><strong>Information You Disclose Publicly.</strong>&nbsp;You may submit photographs, user profiles, written material, music, video, photos, comments and other content, which may include information relating to individual users (collectively, “<strong>UGC</strong>”) on the Services. We do not control who will have access to the UGC you choose to make public or how they will use it and take no responsibility for ensuring such UGC remains private or is secure. The UGC is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We are also not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any UGC that you disclose or receive through the Services. Please see our Terms of Use for further information about the terms that govern the UGC you post.</li>
<li><strong>Other Individuals, Services, and Partners at Your Request.</strong>&nbsp;We will share your information with other individuals and services at your request.
<ul>
<li>For example, if you choose to interact with such co-branded products or services using your account information with us, we may share your account information with third parties as required to provide the co-branded product or service that you request, including any information required for contest prize fulfillment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Contests and Promotions Providers.</strong>&nbsp;In some cases, you may have entered a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, in which case the information you provide via the contest or sweepstakes may be shared by us with that third party for their use in their discretion, including direct marketing. Some of our contests and sweepstakes will ask you at the time of entry whether you would like to have your personal information shared with the sponsor, in which case we will honor your selection. Other contests will not give you that option and in that event, if you do not want your information to be shared, you should not enter the contest. The privacy policies of such third party companies apply to their use and disclosure of your information that we collect and disclose to such third party companies.</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Partners to Provide Co-Branded Products and Services.</strong>&nbsp;Some of our Services may from time to time partner with a retailer or other third party to offer online shopping opportunities, games, services, subscriptions, registration opportunities for our events and summits and other applications on a co-branded or cross-promotional basis (“<strong>Co-Branded Areas</strong>”). The information you provide in connection with the transaction may be collected directly by, or shared by PMC with, the third party, as well as with any participating sponsors or advertisers of such Co-Branded Areas. Some of our Services may offer you the ability to access a third-party site with whom we have a relationship to access both sites through a co-branded registration or password; in that event, your applicable registration information may be collected directly by, or shared by PMC with, the third-party partner. For example, if you choose to interact with such co-branded products or services using your account information with us, we may share your account information with third parties as required to provide the co-branded product or service that you request, including any information required for contest prize fulfillment or customer service. These third parties will use your information in accordance with their own privacy policy.</li>
<li><strong>Third Parties for Marketing Purposes.</strong>&nbsp;We may share your information with partners whose offerings may interest you such as other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases and non-profit organizations. This includes licensing information about your interests and activities, and marketing segments created with such data, which we may share with third parties for their marketing purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Online Advertisers, Ad Networks and Advertising Partners.</strong>&nbsp;As discussed in the “<a href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#online"><strong>Online Analytics and Advertising</strong></a>” Section below, the Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use, and these technologies will collect certain information from your use of the Services to assist in delivering such ads and marketing messages and enhancing our information. These third parties include advertising networks, data exchanges, ad servers, certain analytics providers and others. The list of third party providers is found in the Section below entitled “<a href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#cookies"><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong></a>”. This list may be updated from time to time.</li>
<li><strong>Third Parties for Legal Purposes.</strong>&nbsp;By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain, and disclose the information we collect and maintain about you if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, retention or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process or a regulatory investigation (e.g. a subpoena or court order); (b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; and/or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of PMC, its agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Social Networks.</strong>&nbsp;As noted above, if you use your login credentials from a social media networking service on a Website, we may receive information from such service in accordance with its terms and privacy policy and your settings. If you elect to share your information with these social networking sites, we will share information with them in accordance with your election. The terms and conditions of these social networking sites will apply to the information we disclose to them.</li>
<li><strong>Sales or Transfer of Business or Assets.</strong>&nbsp;In connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise, including via bankruptcy) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the Website to which this policy applies, in which case the company will possess the information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your information as described in this Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Acquisition Use</strong>”).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="legal"></a>5. Legal Grounds for Using (Processing) Your Information</h2>
<p>If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above will depend on the information concerned and the context in which we collect it. We collect information from you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where we need it to perform our contract with you (i.e. our Terms of Service),</li>
<li>Where the processing is in our legitimate interests (provided that these aren’t overridden by your interests or rights) (such as personalizing our services and marketing for example), or</li>
<li>If we otherwise have your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “<a href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#contact"><strong>Contact Us</strong></a>” section below.</p>
<h2><a id="online"></a>6. Online Analytics and Advertising</h2>
<p><strong>Delivery of Advertising and Other Content.&nbsp;</strong>In addition to ads and content that we serve you directly, PMC may use third party advertising companies and marketing services to serve ads and other content when you visit the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests. Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1"><strong>Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out Page</strong></a>, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link, or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/"><strong>Your Online Choices</strong></a>&nbsp;to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.</p>
<p>To learn more about how to manage your preferences regarding our cookie-based advertising, please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#cookies"><strong>“Cookie Management” section in our Cookie Notice below</strong></a>.</p>
<p>To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated"><strong>Google Ads Settings page</strong></a>. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Advertising.</strong>&nbsp;When using mobile applications from PMC or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. Often, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your mobile device or resetting the “Advertising Identifier” (like an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous “Advertising Identifier.” You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track.&nbsp;</strong>PMC does not act on “do not track” requests from your browser because, this way, we are able to personalize your experiences on our Services.</p>
<h2><a id="data"></a>7. Your Rights &amp; Your Choices</h2>
<p><strong>Marketing Emails.&nbsp;</strong>If you want to stop receiving promotional e-mails from us, click on the “unsubscribe” link in any promotional email from us. Please note that once we receive your request, it may take an additional period of time for your opt-out to become effective. We may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with transaction information about the Services you are using, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"><strong>SMS Text Communications.</strong>&nbsp;You may opt-out of SMS messages from us by following the instructions provided in the message or by texting back STOP to the number we send the text from for that particular SMS message. When we receive an opt-out message from you for SMS messages, we may send a message confirming our receipt of your opt-out.</span></p>
<p><a id="california"></a><strong>Privacy Information for California Residents.</strong> If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding your rights with respect to your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).

<h3><a id="california-data-access-deletion-rights"></a>A. California Data Access &amp; Deletion Rights</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information. Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:</p>

We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.</p>

<h3><a id="notice-right-optout"></a>B. Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information</h3>
<p>California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. We sell certain of your information to third parties to provide you with offers and promotions and opportunities that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Under the CCPA, sale is also broadly defined such that it may include allowing third parties to receive certain information, such as cookies, IP address, and/or browsing behavior, to deliver targeted advertising on the Services or other services. Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables us to provide you certain content for free and allows us to provide you offers relevant to you.</p>
<p>Depending on what Services you use, we may provide the following categories of personal information to third parties for these purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>For online targeted advertising purposes: demographic and statistical information, user-generated content, device information and identifiers, connection and usage data, geolocation, and social media information.</li>
<li>For sharing with third parties to send you relevant offers and promotions and opportunities: contact information (e.g., name and physical address) and publication subscription information.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to opt out of PMC’s use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” under California law, you may do so as outlined on the following page:&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.com/opt-out/"><strong>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</strong></a>. You can also submit a sale opt-out request by calling us at&nbsp;<a href="tel:+18773653500"><strong>(877) 365-3500</strong></a>. Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.</p>
<p>Please note that PMC employees who are seeking further information about their legal rights under California law should instead contact their PMC HR representative. Applicants submitting information on the PMC Careers pages at&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.com/careers-listing/"><strong>pmc.com/careers-listing</strong></a>&nbsp;should instead consult the Penske Media Corporation Human Resources Privacy Notice referenced therein.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your access, deletion or sale opt out rights.</span></p>
<h3><a id="shine-the-light"></a>C. California “Shine the Light” Disclosure</h3>
<p>The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you would like to opt out of such sharing, please use the sale opt out form noted above. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: PMC, 11175 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90025, Attn: Privacy Officer. In your request, please specify that you want a “PMC California Privacy Rights Notice.” Please allow at least 30 days for a response.</p>
<h3><a id="international-users"></a>D. International Users</h3>
<p>Some international users of our Services have certain legal rights to access certain information we hold about them and to request its deletion. For example, your local laws may permit you to request that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we have about you;</li>
<li>Prevent the processing of your information for direct-marketing purposes;</li>
<li>Update information which is out of date or incorrect;</li>

<li>Restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information;</li>
<li>Transfer your information to a third party provider of services; and</li>
<li>Revoke your consent for the processing of your information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">If you would like further information in relation to your legal rights under applicable law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us using the information in the “<a href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#contact"><strong>Contact Us</strong></a>” section below at any time.</span></p>
<h3><a id="nevada-residents"></a>E. Privacy Information for Nevada Residents</h3>
<p>Under Nevada law, Nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from us may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such terms are defined under Nevada law). “Covered information” includes, among other things, first and last name, address, email address, and phone number. As discussed above, we share your information with third parties (e.g. magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases) that want to market products or services to you. In some circumstances, this sharing may qualify as a sale under Nevada law. If you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of such activity by filling out the form located&nbsp;<a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/e65b3c4c-fa81-40d2-9df0-c7e99bf5f900/draft/dcc21664-2b4b-434e-838a-8f1c6e9d9fdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.

<h2><a id="california-privacy-notice"></a>Appendix A: California Privacy Notice</h2>
<p>This Privacy Notice for California residents supplements the&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/"><strong>PMC Privacy Policy</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This Notice applies to website visitors, app users, event attendees and other customers in California. This Notice does not apply to employees, former employees, candidates, contractors, service providers, or business contacts of PMC. This supplemental privacy notice gives California residents additional information about our information collection and use practices required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). The CCPA also provides California residents with specific privacy rights, which are outlined in our Privacy Policy&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This notice provides information about the categories of personal information that we collect from California residents generally, the purposes for which we use the information, the sources of the information, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose the information for business purposes. More detailed information is available in our Privacy Policy at&nbsp;<a href="http://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#use"><strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#share"><strong>How We Share Personal Information</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to opt out of PMC’s use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” under California law, you may do so as outlined on the following page:&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.com/opt-out/"><strong>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</strong></a>. You can also submit a sale opt-out request by emailing us by calling us at&nbsp;<a href="tel:+18773653500"><strong>(877) 365-3500</strong></a>. Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.<br>
Please note that PMC employees who are seeking further information about their legal rights under California law should instead contact their PMC HR representative. Applicants submitting information on the PMC Careers pages at&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.com/careers-listing/"><strong>pmc.com/careers-listing</strong></a>&nbsp;should instead consult the Penske Media Corporation Human Resources Privacy Notice referenced therein.</p>
