        Taming a busy life requires a lot of items. We created Adero to help you proactively know everything you need is where you need when you need it. And the best part, it does it all on its own–one less thing for you to worry about.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What makes Adero different?
    </h3>
    <strong>
        Organized from the start
    </strong>
    Like other item finders, Adero can locate misplaced items in a pinch. But wouldn't it be better if you never lost your stuff in the first place? Our Smart Tags act as a personal assistant for your bags, keeping track of the items you need most to make it through the day.
    <strong>
        Rechargeable
    </strong>
    Your items shouldn't be at the mercy of a dime-sized battery that needs constant replacing. That's why our Smart Tags are rechargeable and every Adero Kit come with a USB charger.
    <strong>
        Proactive reminders
    </strong>
    Within the Adero app, Reminders work to notify you before you a critical item is left behind. Simply set them up in the app to remind you at a particular date and time or recurring cadence.
    <strong>
        Peace of mind at your fingertips
    </strong>
    Press a Smart Tag to instantly know if anything is missing - even if your phone isn't with you. A green light means everything is good-to-go, while a red light signals one more more items aren't in your bag.
