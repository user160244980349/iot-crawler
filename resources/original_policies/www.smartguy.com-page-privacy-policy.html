								<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>SmartGuy.com Privacy Policy</b></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">SmartGuy.com, a division of Cristal Solutions, Inc. (hereinafter collectively "SmartGuy.com"), is committed to protecting the privacy of users of our website. All the terms and definitions in our Website's Terms of Use located at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartguy.com/page/terms-of-use"><span class="s2">https://www.smartguy.com/page/terms-of-use</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;are incorporated by reference herein. Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Website and our Services (collectively the “<b>Services</b>”). This Privacy Policy applies to our Website and governs data collection and usage at our Website. Please read it in its entirety.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Information Provided to Match User with Contractors and Service Professionals</b></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">To provide users (“Users”) with the best possible experience, SmartGuy.com may collect personally identifiable information (“<b>Personal Information</b>”), including, but not limited to, your first and last name, email address, location, including street address, state, and zip code, and phone number. When you submit information to SmartGuy.com requesting our Services, you authorize us to share this information with our network of “<b>Contractors and Service Professionals</b>” (Contractors, Tradesmen, Architects, etc.) in order to try to provide the services you request. For example, when an approved member of our service professional network accepts a lead from a registered user, and that User indicates what personal information they are willing to share so that the Contractor or Service Professional can contact the User, such as telephone numbers and email addresses, that information is shared with our Contractors and Service Professionals who have accepted a service request lead. We may also post and publish users' Ratings and Reviews of Contractors' or Service Professionals' performance, as well as Feedbacks and Testimonials at our sole discretion.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you communicate with us by e-mail, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or the like, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personally Identifiable Information.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Further, if you are a Contractor or Service Professional, we will collect your location information, if you enter your business address, to assist Users in identifying you as a potential service provider. You may use the Services without enabling the location feature, however this may affect the overall functionality of the Services. You may delete your location information at any time by contacting us at customerservice@smartguy.com or by following the instructions provided within the Services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">In light of the nature of the Services, certain user actions in which you participate may be collected and stored by SmartGuy.com and may be broadcast publicly, and subsequently used or shared by SmartGuy.com, Contractors and Service Providers, or other Users. Such actions include, but are not limited to, posting Feedback and Testimonials, as well as information about your business (collectively “User Generated Content”). By consenting to this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent SmartGuy.com’s and certain User’s and Contractors’ or Service Providers’ of such User Generated Content for any reason in connection with the Services.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Other Types of Information We May Collect</b></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Through the use of cookie technology or otherwise, we may track and collect information about your computer and software when you visit our website. This information can include: (i) your IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type of computer; (iv) type of web browser; (v) access times; and (vi) referring websites addresses (collectively "<b>Traffic Data</b>"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you. Traffic Data helps us to design and deliver the most user-friendly web pages, allows for constant improvement to our Website and enables us to best satisfy the needs of our users, customers and prospective customers.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Use of Cookies</b></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">We employ cookie technology to store and sometimes track information about the users of our Website. We use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent the browser from accepting the cookie.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">SmartGuy.com will not follow any browser, extension, or other application’s Do Not Track signal or any other similar anti-tracking signals. However, we offer other choices with respect to third parties. Many third parties participate in self-regulation to offer you a choice regarding receiving targeted ads. Please note that you’ll still see generic ads after opting out, but they won’t be based on your activities online. On the web, you can opt out of participating companies by visiting the following sites:</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>http://optout.networkadvertising.org/</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">•<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>http://optout.aboutads.info/<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you wish to similarly opt out of cross-app advertising on mobile devices, you can enable the Limit Ad Tracking flag on the device. Enabling Limit Ad Tracking sends a flag to third parties that you wish to opt out of targeted advertising on that device, and major mobile platforms require companies to honor this flag. Screenshots on how to find these options on various devices are available here: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices"><span class="s3">http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices</span></a>.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What Are Cookies?</b></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a website. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on the user's hard drive.

This makes it easier for a user to move from web page to web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.
