            Your California Privacy Rights
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third
        <br/>
        parties for direct marketing purposes. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide this information
        <br/>
        if it permits California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. GSM qualifies for this alternative
        <br/>
        option. To opt out of having your information shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please call
        <br/>
