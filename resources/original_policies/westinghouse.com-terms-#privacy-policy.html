<ul>
<li><strong>Governing Law, Venue, and Jurisdiction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These Terms and all claims as between you and us arising from or related to your use of the Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, except California’s conflict of law rules.&nbsp; These Terms will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, if applicable.</p>
<p>With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration (as set forth below), you agree to jurisdiction in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California.&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, we may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, you must file any claim or action related to use of the Services or these Terms within one year after such claim or action accrued.&nbsp; Otherwise, you will waive the claim or action.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disputes; Arbitration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any dispute with or claim against us or any of our affiliates, or if we have a dispute with or claim against you, in either case arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms (a “<strong>Claim</strong>”), and the Claim is not resolved by calling our customer service department at (866)442-7873, you and we each agree to resolve such Claim through an individual binding arbitration or through an individual action in small claims court in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence or in San Francisco, California. Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and your Claim may not be consolidated with any other person’s claim. You and we agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Section 17 shall survive termination of these Terms or any subscription that you may have to any of the Services.</p>
<p>Before you or we commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action with respect to a Claim, you must first send to Westinghouse a written notice of your claim or we must send a written notice of our claim to you (“<strong>Notice</strong>“). Your Notice must (1) be sent by certified mail; (2) be addressed to: <strong>Corporate Headquarters Westinghouse Electric Corporation</strong> c/o Westinghouse Legal Department 20 Stanwix Street Pittsburgh, PA 15222; (3) describe the nature of your Claim; and (4) specify the damages or other relief you seek. If we and you do not then resolve the Claim within 30 days after our receipt of Notice is received, either you or we may commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action to resolve the Claim.</p>
<p>Any such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association and be conducted in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”). Contact information for the American Arbitration Association, as well as copies of the Rules and applicable forms, are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org/">http://www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;In circumstances in which the Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will take place in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in San Francisco, California. For any non-frivolous Claim that does not exceed $50,000, Westinghouse will pay all costs of the arbitration, and reimburse any filing fees you may be required to pay. If the arbitrator awards you damages that are greater than Westinghouse’s last written settlement offer communicated before commencement of the arbitration, Westinghouse will pay you the greater of $1,000 or the amount of the award.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We may be required by state or federal law to notify you of certain events.&nbsp; You hereby acknowledge and agree that such notices will be effective upon our posting them in the relevant Service or delivering them to you via email.&nbsp; You may update your email address by visiting the Services where you have provided contact information.&nbsp; If you do not provide us with accurate information, we will not be responsible for failure to notify you.&nbsp; Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.&nbsp; These Terms, including all additional terms, conditions, and policies on the Services, constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all prior agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof.&nbsp; Nothing in these Terms affects any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to you.&nbsp; If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be removed, and the remainder of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>You authorize us to provide information concerning you and your activities to comply with applicable laws or respond to court order, subpoenas, or other lawful requests, or if we believe doing so would protect your safety or that of another person or protect the security of the Services, or as otherwise described in the&nbsp;<a href="https://westinghouse.com/terms/#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not agree to these Terms, you should immediately stop using the Services.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you want to delete your account on a Service, please use contact instructions posted on the Service at which you obtained the account.&nbsp;Sections 6 and 11-14 of these Terms will survive any termination of your access to the Services, whether we terminate your access or you voluntarily discontinue your use.</p>

<p>Westinghouse is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share information collected about you. We may share information collected about you as disclosed at the time of collection, as otherwise disclosed in this privacy policy, and in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>With your consent.</strong>With your consent, we may share your contact information with third party marketing partners. You acknowledge that when you disclose personal information on the Westinghouse Services and you allow your information to be shared with third parties, they can contact you by email, telephone, postal mail or other common communication methods with marketing and promotional messages about their products or services. Sometimes we may give you the option to receive further communications from one of our advertising partners, for example when we run a competition in conjunction with that advertiser. If you do choose to opt in by expressly providing consent to receive communications from that third party advertiser, your personal information will be managed by that third party’s own privacy policy (which may be made available for you to view at the time that you opt in).</li>
<li><strong>Authorized third party service providers.</strong>We share your contact information with third party vendors who help us with specialized services, including customer support, email and text message deployment, business analytics, marketing, suppression list management and data processing. These third parties are allowed to use your contact information to help us provide our services and not for any other purpose. Also, authorized third party service providers may collect non-contact information about your visits to our Services with cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies that may be used to deliver advertisements or marketing tailored to your interests or, in connection with other data about you including data regarding your use of websites, apps or other services over time and across the Internet, to determine the connections that may exist among different devices. For example, if your IP address is associated with multiple devices (such as smartphones, connected TVs, tablets and so on), these services providers may determine that you, as a user, are connected to such devices.

All terms applicable to the particular promotion will be made available to you at the time you enter the promotion.</li>
<li><strong>Co-Branded Partners.</strong>Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom a Westinghouse Service may jointly offer a service or feature.

You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Co-Branded Partner, or we may share your information with the Co-Branded Partner.

<p>Most Westinghouse Services are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect or store contact information about children under the age of 13 in the United States or the appropriate age for services directed toward children as defined under applicable laws in other jurisdictions. Some Westinghouse Services may ask for your full date of birth date to ensure that they are not collecting information from children under 13 in the United States or the appropriate age for services directed toward children as defined under applicable laws in other jurisdictions or to identify when additional steps may need to be taken when information has been collected from children under 18 or under the age of majority in their jurisdiction, if higher than 18. In those instances where a Westinghouse Service has actual knowledge that it collects information from children or offers a service directed toward children as defined under applicable laws, it will comply with those laws.
