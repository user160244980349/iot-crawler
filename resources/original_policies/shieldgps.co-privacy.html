          <ol>
            <li>
            We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data:
            </li>
            <li>
            To perform the contract, we are to enter into or have entered into with you;
            </li>
            <li>
            To comply with a legal obligation; and 
            </li>
            <li>
            Where it is necessary to carry out our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
            </li>
            <li>
            Part 2 of Schedule 1 sets out the lawful basis we will rely on to process your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
            We do generally only rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data to send email and SMS marketing communications and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us. Please note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your information.
            </li>
            <li>
            We may analyse your personal data to form a view on what products and or services we think may be of interest to you. You will only receive marketing communications from us, if you have requested information from us or purchased services from us, if you consent to marketing at the time we collect your personal data and you have not subsequently opted out or withdrawn your consent or if we have another basis to send you the marketing communications.
            </li>
            <li>
            We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
            You can opt out of email marketing by clicking the unsubscribe button within the marketing email. You can also withdraw your consent to marketing at any time by contacting our DPM. 
            </li>
            <li>
            Even if you opt out of receiving marketing, we may still use your personal data for other purposes provided we have a lawful basis to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
            We will only use your personal data for the purpose that we originally collected it for, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
            If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to use your personal data in this manner.
            </li>
            <li>
            We may process your personal data (without your knowledge or consent) where this is required or permitted by law.
