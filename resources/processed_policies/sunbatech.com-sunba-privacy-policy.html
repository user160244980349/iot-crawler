            Data Safety Commitments

    </p>
    <p>
        The online services offered by Sunba and its affiliates use encryption on web pages where personal information is collected (for example, credit card and other payment information). To use these services, we recommend you use an SSL-enabled browser such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal information while itâ€™s transmitted over the Internet. Internet data transmissions can always be exposed to a certain level of risk. Sunba is committed to protecting your privacy with administrative and technical measures against any data loss and theft. However, with the existing security technology, Sunba cannot guarantee that your personal information is under absolute security. You acknowledge that Sunba is not liable for any losses with any personal information revealed or stolen due to security issues not caused by Sunba.
