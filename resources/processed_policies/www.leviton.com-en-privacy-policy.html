    <p>
        For California resident-specific information, please refer to Section 11 below.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you use or connect to the Leviton Website through your computer or a mobile device, Leviton collects certain information from and about its users in a few ways: directly from our web server logs, from the User, with the aid of cookies, with web beacons, and through the use of Website analytics through a third party service provider. The type of information that gets collected depends on the section of our site that the user accesses. A large portion of our Website can be accessed by the general public without a need to share any kind of personal information. In those areas of the site, the information collected may include IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name, session length, etc. This information, of anonymous nature, allows Leviton to measure the performance of its Website, and come up with possible improvements for it. Leviton may use this type information, which does not reveal the user identity, in whatever fashion it deems necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visitors to our Website can register to create an account, access the Website, and download Software. When you register for an account, we will request some personal information such as your name, address, e-mail, telephone number or fax number, location, and other relevant information. Leviton will not resell or share this information with any outside entity unless that’s required in order for us to comply with a law, or a court order, or to protect our vital business interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you purchase products from the Leviton Website, your complete purchase order is processed by Leviton, but your payment information is submitted directly by you to a third party Website for processing of your payment only. Leviton does not collect, store, or see your credit card information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leviton is committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access by having various administrative and technology safeguards in place. Any page at our site that asks you for sensitive information is highly secure. Most browsers will show a lock icon in the bottom status bar on secure pages. Look for this icon on any web page that asks for sensitive information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any other communication you transmit to the Website, such as questions, comments, suggestions, or the like, will not be encrypted or otherwise secured or treated confidentially.

            Web Server Logs
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        When you visit our Website, we may track information through web server logs to better administer the site and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include but is not limited to your Internet Protocol address, the type of browser or computer you use, the number of links you click within the Website, the geographical location from which you accessed it, the date and time of your visit, the name of your Internet service provider, any web pages you linked to our Website from, and pages you viewed on the Website.

            Use of Cookies
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Leviton may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server to identify that specific user the next time he or she visits the Website. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information, as well as providing personalized functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not allow other companies to place cookies on our Website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as integrating another site that relies on third-party cookies into the existing Website).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Modifying cookie settings
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. The help function of your browser should contain instructions to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. If you set your computer to not receive cookies at any time, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you, and accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Website features (i.e. you will be able to browse the site, but will not be able to make a purchase).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Use of Web Beacons or GIF Files

Leviton may include Web Beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Leviton prohibits Web Beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.

            4. NOTICE ON DISCLOSURE OF USER PERSONAL INFORMATION

        Leviton reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with its affiliates and strategic partners to help enhance its service offerings, but does not sell identifiable personal information to third party marketing companies. Personal User information collected by or submitted to Leviton shall not be disclosed to any third parties without your permission, unless such information: (i) is to fulfill your service requests; (ii) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, legal process, or law enforcement or government regulatory authorities, in which case we shall give you as much advance notice as is reasonably practicable in order to allow you to limit or restrict to such disclosure; or (iii) is required to be disclosed in order for us to protect our legal rights or defend against liability; or (iv) in connection with a company reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale.

            11. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS – FOR USERS WHO ARE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Leviton does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our App that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to
        <a href="mailto:privacy@leviton.com">
            privacy@leviton.com
        </a>
        or write us at: 201 N. Service Road, Melville, NY 11747.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section of Leviton’s Privacy Policy applies to California residents only, to comply with the requirements of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (the “
        <strong>
            CCPA
        </strong>
        ”). Any terms defined within the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Section 11 of the Privacy Policy.

            Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least 12 months before asking you to reauthorize PI disclosure or sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to PI disclosures or sales at any time by supplying your PI to Leviton on its Website or by contacting Leviton at
            <a href="mailto:privacy@leviton.com">
                privacy@leviton.com
            </a>
            . You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use PI provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.

        <li>
            To not be discriminated against if you exercise your CCPA rights, meaning that Leviton will not deny you goods or services, charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties, provide you a different level or quality of goods or services, suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. However, Leviton may offer and you may consent to receive certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive Leviton offers will reasonably relate to your PI’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. You may revoke your consent to participate or receive such financial incentive at any time.

        Under the Age of 16

    <p>
        Leviton’s Website is not intended for children under 16 years of age. No one under age 16 may provide any PI on the Website. We do not knowingly collect PI from children under 16, unless we receive affirmative authorization from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. If you are under 16, do not use or provide any information on this Website. If we learn we have collected or received PI from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at

        Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
    </p>
    <p>
        You can exercise any of the rights listed above by submitting a request to us using one of the three methods listed here:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Visiting our opt-out form at

            </a>
            (and put “CCPA request” in the subject line, and include with specificity what you are requesting); or,
        </li>
        <li>
            Calling Leviton’s toll-free number at 1 (877) 797-0879.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Responding to Your Request
    </p>
    <p>
        Once we receive and confirm your request, we will respond within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days or as otherwise permitted by law), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the date of the receipt of the request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your PI that is readily usable and should allow you to transfer the information from one entity to another without difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Who may make a request?
    </p>
    <p>
        Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your PI. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you, or the person on whose behalf you are requesting, are the person about whom we collected PI; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with PI if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the PI relates to you. Making a request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use PI provided in a request to verify your identity.
