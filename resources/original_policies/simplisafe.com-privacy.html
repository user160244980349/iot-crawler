        <h1>SimpliSafe Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: February 2020</strong></p>
        <h6>1. INTRODUCTION</h6>
        <p> SimpliSafe, Inc. ("SimpliSafe") takes your privacy seriously. We believe in protecting your information as well as your person and belongings. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to describe how SimpliSafe collects, uses and shares information about our customers, whether obtained through our call center or online interfaces (e.g., website and mobile applications) owned and controlled by us, including <a href="/">www.simplisafe.com</a> (collectively referred to herein as the “Site”). Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do. If you do not understand any aspects of our Privacy Policy, please feel free to <a href="/contact-us">Contact Us</a> or as described in Section 7 of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p> Our Privacy Policy explains: </p>

        <p><strong>Scope; Third Party Sites</strong></p>
        <p> This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect at and through the Site. Our Site also contains links to third party sites that are not owned or controlled by SimpliSafe. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal information. </p>

        <p><strong>Additional Terms</strong></p>
        <p> Please reference our <a href="/terms-sale">Terms of Sale</a> which apply to your purchase of our products. Please also note that use of our Site is subject to the <a href="/terms-of-use">Website Terms of Use</a>. Moreover, if you subscribe to SimpliSafe’s monitoring services or activate service offerings made available in connection with a SimpliSafe product that do not require a monitoring subscription, use of those services are also subject to the <a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>. </p>

        <h6 id="collect">2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY WE COLLECT IT</h6>

        <p> SimpliSafe collects certain information to enable you to take full advantage of our offerings when you register at our Site, order products or services either through the Site or through our call center, communicate with customer service representatives, participate in our contests, surveys, promotions, or activities, or otherwise communicate with us. If you choose, you can visit the Site without providing us with any information about yourself. </p>

        <p> We seek to limit the collection and use of customer information required to deliver service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business. </p>

        <p><strong>Personal Information You Provide To Us When You Become a Customer</strong></p>
        <p> Types of personal information we collect when you become a customer and provide it to us include: </p>

        <ul class="privacy-policy-list">
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Address</li>
            <li>Billing address</li>
            <li>Shipping address</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Telephone number</li>
            <li>Demographic information about you</li>
            <li>Credit card, debit card and bank account numbers (solely for payment purposes)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Personal Information You Provide To Us When You Subscribe to Monitoring Service</strong></p>
        <p> Types of personal information we collect when you become a subscriber to monitoring services and you provide it to us include: </p>

        <ul class="privacy-policy-list">
            <li>The number of adults and children living at the location where the alarm will be installed</li>
            <li>Whether the location is a home, apartment or business</li>
            <li>Name and telephone number for friends or family you would like to be contracted in the event of an alarm</li>
            <li>Information such as your “safe word” and log-in  credentials used to verify your identity if you forget your log in   credentials for your SimpliSafe account</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Telephone number</li>
            <li>Demographic information about you</li>
            <li>Information such as your alarm activity stored in your online account. This activity includes, but is not limited to, when the alarm is armed and disarmed, and when an alarm event is triggered</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Personal Information Collected through the Security Camera or other Camera-Enabled Products</strong></p>
        <p> When you enable the recording features of your security camera or other camera-enabled products (for example, SimpliSafe’s video doorbell product), we will record, store, and process video and/or audio recordings from the device, depending on how you configure the camera and its settings. This may include capturing and making available to you portions of the recording data as part of a notification or analysis of the data to identify motion or other events. We process and store information from your camera-enabled product so that we can send you alerts when there is an event. If you have the recording features enabled, during the subscription period applicable to your camera-enabled product we will capture, process, and store video and audio recordings from your camera for at least 30 days from the date such data is first recorded and stored on our systems ("SimpliSafe's date of first capture"). During your subscription period, you will be able to access those recordings for up to 30 days from SimpliSafe's date of first capture of such data. </p>

        <p><strong>NOTE: Privacy laws in your state may impose certain obligations on you and your use of security camera or other camera-enabled products. You (not SimpliSafe) are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use such camera-enabled products. For example, you may be required to display a notice (even inside your home) that alerts visitors to your home that you are using a security camera or other camera-enabled products that are recording audio and video. Please also consider that recording and sharing of video that involves other people may affect their privacy rights.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>SimpliSafe Product or Account Interaction with Third Parties</strong></p>

        <p>If SimpliSafe offers any product or account connections or integrations with third-party products, applications, functionality, or services (collectively, “Third-Party Products and Services”), and you choose to enable or connect to such Third-Party Products and Services through the means authorized and directed by SimpliSafe and/or such third-party partners, you acknowledge and agree that we may share certain information about you with such third parties for account authentication and management, and to enable the activation, connection and integration with and to such Third-Party Products and Services on such third parties’ platforms. For example, when you elect to use Third-Party Products and Services, such as SimpliSafe’s Amazon Alexa Skill, the August Smart Lock, Apple Watch or Google Assistant (as and when each is introduced), you agree that we may provide certain data about you to such partners in order to enable the activation, connection and integration with and to such Third-Party Products and Services you intend to use or otherwise choose to activate. In some cases, SimpliSafe or the third-party partner will instead (or also) ask for permission to control the SimpliSafe products and services and/or Third-Party Products and Services that you have activated and connected to as contemplated hereunder. Your consent is required to allow any of these exchanges or requests for control and you will be able to revoke or disable it at any time.</p>

        <p>In addition, SimpliSafe may share information with such third-party partners with your permission. For example, when you enroll or activate Third-Party Products and Services, you may be asked for your permission to share certain data between SimpliSafe and our partner. SimpliSafe requires your consent before sharing information in these circumstances. We may also receive information from our partners and other sources and combine that with the information in your SimpliSafe account to determine eligibility and efficacy of our programs.</p>

        <p>Additional information about the limited circumstances in which information from your SimpliSafe account may be shared with third parties is described below in the section titled "How we Use and Share Your Information".</p>

        <p>Any SimpliSafe data that you choose to share with a third party, either directly or by or on behalf of SimpliSafe through the authorizations, integrations and connections permitted hereunder, is governed by that third party&lt;’s privacy policy while in that party’s possession.</p>

        <p>Any data that SimpliSafe receives from third parties will be processed and stored by SimpliSafe and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This information may be processed in the same ways as any other data that is a part of your SimpliSafe account.</p>

        <p><strong>No Information From Children or Teens Under Age 18</strong></p>
        <p> This Site is not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from, children or teenagers under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register with us at this Site or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this Site under the supervision of your parents or guardians. </p>

        <p><strong>Third-Party Sites and Social Media</strong></p>
        <p> Our Site may contain links to other websites operated by third parties and may include social media features such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest buttons or links. These third-party sites may collect information about you if you click on a link and the social media sites may automatically record information about your browsing behavior every time you visit a site that has a social media button. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the link, not this privacy policy. </p>

        <p><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong></p>
        <p> If you use our “tell-a-friend” feature, we ask for your friend’s name and e-mail address.  We use this information only to send the communication you requested and to monitor the effectiveness of our tell-a-friend feature. </p>

        <h6 id="how-we-use">3. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h6>

        <p><strong>To Provide Products, Services, and Information</strong></p>

        <p> As described above, we collect information from you so that we can provide products and services that you purchase from us, and to provide information that you request from us. This includes sending you alarm alerts and important service information about your alarm and our services. We use your personal information to contact you about your orders, process credit card / debit card transactions, and ship our products to you. We may send you information about our products and services, and new offerings. We may provide information to third party service providers that help us process orders and fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us. You may opt out of receiving future communications (with the exception of alarm alerts and service information) from us by logging into your account and editing your profile.  You may also opt out of receiving commercial e-mail from us by following the instructions in each e-mail. To ensure reliability and improve your experience with our mobile app, we share information with Google Firebase to measure your in-app experience and improve its usability, speed, and reliability; only non-personally identifiable information is shared. </p>

        <p> If you subscribe for monitoring services, or make other purchases through the Site, your credit card or debit card information (such as card type and expiration date) and other financial data that we need to process your payment may be collected and stored by the payment processors with which we work. We may also collect some limited information, such as your postal code, mobile number, and details of your transaction history, all of which are necessary to provide the monitoring services or products. In addition, the payment processors generally provide us with some limited information related to you, such as a unique token that enables you to make additional purchases using the information they’ve stored, including recurring payments if you become a subscriber, and your card’s type, expiration date, and certain digits of your card number. </p>

        <p> We use third parties to assist with providing our products and services to you (including our alarm monitoring services and dispatching emergency responders), host our Site, send out email updates about the Site, provide marketing and advertising services for us, remove repetitive information from our user lists, and process payments. These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to help us provide the service. We also employ strong security and technological controls and provisions to protect against unauthorized SimpliSafe employee access to the audio and video data collected from your security camera or other camera-enabled products. </p>

        <p id="how-we-use-advertising"><strong>Advertising</strong></p>

        <p> We may use how you browse and shop in order to show you ads for SimpliSafe or our advertising partners that are more relevant to your interests. We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our Site or third-party sites not owned by SimpliSafe. </p>

        <p> We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites to show you interest-based advertisements on those websites. Our Site does not respond to “do not track” signals or similar mechanisms to indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the <a href="https://www.aboutads.info">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> websites (<a href="https://www.aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info</a> and <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>). </p>

        <p><strong>Your Consent</strong></p>

        <p> Except as otherwise provided in this Policy, we will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of SimpliSafe when we have your consent to do so. </p>

        <p><strong>Legal Proceedings</strong></p>

        <p> We will share personal information with third party companies, organizations or individuals outside of SimpliSafe if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: </p>

        <ul class="privacy-policy-list">
            <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or governmental request.</li>
            <li>Enforce applicable <a href="/terms-sale">Terms of Sale</a> and <a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
            <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
            <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of SimpliSafe, our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control</strong></p>
        <p> If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the Site to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your personal information to the new owner. In such a case, unless permitted or otherwise directed by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the terms of the applicable privacy policy in effect at the time of such transfer. </p>

        <h6 id="access">4. ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION AND CHOICES</h6>

        <p> You can access and update certain information we have relating to your online account by logging into your online account and visiting the “monitoring” section to update contact information for your alarm monitoring and dispatch. Under the “log in” section you can update your email address and password.

        <h6 id="ccpa">8. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY NOTICE</h6>

        <p><strong>Effective: January 1, 2020</strong></p>

        <p><strong>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</strong></p>

        <p><strong>If you are a resident of California, this California privacy notice applies to you and supplements SimpliSafe’s main Privacy Policy. This California privacy notice is intended to provide certain additional information to you as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).</strong></p>

        <p> “Personal information” as used in this California privacy notice applies to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you or your household such as your real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers. Personal information does not include publicly-available information and certain other information that is regulated by other applicable laws. </p>

        <p> We do not sell or monetize our users’ personal information in the traditional sense (i.e., get paid to share your personal information). However, the CCPA defines the term “sale” very broadly, and it likely includes the sharing of personal information with third parties. </p>

        <p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>

        <p><strong><i>Right to Know</i></strong></p>

        <p> You have the right to request that we provide certain information to you about our collection of your personal information. Such information shall cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. Upon our receipt of your verified request, we will provide you with the following: </p>

        <ul class="privacy-policy-list">
            <li>The categories of personal information we have collected about you</li>
            <li>The categories of sources from which we have collected your personal information</li>
            <li>Our business or commercial purpose(s) for collecting or selling your personal information</li>
            <li>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your personal information; and</li>
            <li>The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you</li>
        </ul>

        <p> You have the right to request that we provide certain information to you about our disclosures and sales of your personal information. Such information shall cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. Upon our receipt of your verified request, we will provide you with the following: </p>

        <ul class="privacy-policy-list">
            <li>The categories of personal information we have collected from you</li>
            <li>The categories of personal information we have sold about you and the categories of third parties to whom we sold such information, by category or categories of personal information for each category of third parties to whom the personal information was sold; and</li>
            <li>The categories of personal information that we disclosed about you for a business purpose</li>
        </ul>


        <p> You may only make a verifiable “Right to Know” request twice within a 12-month period. </p>

        <p><strong><i>Right to Opt-Out</i></strong></p>

        <p> We never monetize your personal information, however, we may share it with certain strategic partners, social media partners, advertising partners and networks, and other third parties that provide offers we think may be of value to you as discussed below, which could be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. You have the right at any time to opt-out of this sharing and the potential sale of your personal information by clicking here. </p>

        <p><strong><i>Right to Delete</i></strong></p>

        <p> You have the right at any time to request that we delete your personal information. However, in some cases we cannot delete all or some of your personal information as required or permitted by applicable laws. </p>

        <p><strong><i>Right to Non-Discrimination</i></strong></p>

        <p> We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA, such as by denying you products and services, charging you different rates or prices, including use of discounts or penalties, or suggesting or providing a different level of service or quality of products to you. However, we may charge a different price or provide a different level or quality of products and services if the price or difference is directly related to the value provided to you by your personal information.

        </p><p> We may from time to time offer you financial incentives, including payments to you as compensation, for collecting, selling, or deleting your personal information. We also may offer a different price, rate, level, or quality of goods or services to the consumer if that price or difference is directly related to the value provided to you by your personal information. </p>

        <p><strong>Contact</strong></p>

        <p> To submit a request to exercise your “Right to Know” or “Right to Delete” rights provided in this California privacy notice, please click <a href="/access-delete-info">here</a> or call us at <strong>(844) 746-7547</strong> to submit your request.

        <p> Depending on the nature of your request, we may have to verify your identity when you contact us. We may do this by asking you to: </p>

        <ul class="privacy-policy-list">
            <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized agent.</li>
            <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. </p>

        <p> We endeavor to respond to your request as soon as we can. If we are not able to respond to your request within 45 days, we will let you know that we may require additional time (up to 90 total days). </p>

        <p> You may also use an authorized agent to exercise your rights on your behalf. If you wish to use an authorized agent, we require that your authorized agent provide written proof to us that he or she is authorized to act on your behalf, and we may also require your authorized agent to verify his or her own identity. To appoint an authorized agent, please contact us <a href="/access-delete-info">here</a> (for Right to Know or Right to Delete requests) or <a href="/do-not-sell">here</a> (for Right to Opt-Out requests) or contact us by phone at <strong>(844) 746-7547</strong>. </p>
