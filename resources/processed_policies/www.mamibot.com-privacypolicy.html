    </h2>
    <p>
        We collect and use information about you, our Site users, in several ways. We receive information directly from you when you create an account or send us email. We also collect information electronically when you browse our Website. There are two types of information: anonymous and personal. Personal information is any information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name, address, email address, or phone number. You may be asked to provide personal information anytime you are in contact with us. We may share your personal information with our business affiliates, as described in detail below. We and our affiliates may combine your personal information with other information to provide and improve our products, services, and advertising. You are not required to provide any personal information that we request, but if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our services or respond to any questions you might have.

        </strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The types of information that you provide actively and that we collect electronically all depend on your level of engagement with the Sites. The higher the level of your engagement, the more information we need to serve you. Currently there are two levels of engagement: Website Visitor (you browse theWebsite but do not register), and Registered Robot Owner or Potential Owner. We have organized the explanation of our information collection and use practices from the lowest level of engagement to the highest.

        What We Collect. We collect and store from all Website Visitors, as applicable: the internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the

        browser software you use and your operating system, the date and time you access the Site, the internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website, and other similar information. We use this information to track usage of our Site, to measure the number of unique visitors to the different sections of our Site and to help us make our Site more useful. The use of this information is called “analytics.”
    </p>
    <p>
        We Use Cookies. Like most other websites, we use “cookies” to store information on your computer. A cookie is a small file containing a string of

    <p>
        Third-Party Cookies Used to Target Ads to You When You are on Other Websites.
