    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

    <p>
        We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you initiate contact with METUS regarding an issue or problem, any personal information you provide is voluntary. We collect and use only the minimum information necessary to effectively respond to your concern and/or to conduct an investigation. When METUS directly solicits personal information from you in writing, we will specify how the information will be used and will proceed with appropriate notice and consent, if necessary. If you choose to post or share personal information, including photographs, on any public form on the Sites, please be aware that any information you submit can be read, viewed, collected, or used by other forums user. METUS retains no control over any individuals who may subsequently contact or send unsolicited messages to you and is not responsible for the personal information you choose to provide in these forums.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you provide us with personal information, we may keep a record of the inquiry. In addition, we may store and process personal information and share it with our worldwide subsidiaries and affiliates to better understand your needs and improve our relationship with you. METUS does not use or disclose information gathered from individual visits to the Sites or information you provide to METUS to any third parties with the intention to sell, rent or otherwise market your personal information. METUS may, however, share your personal information with other companies, organizations or individuals if, under a good faith belief, we believe that the access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to (a) meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential violations; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of METUS, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        METUS may at times employ a third party service provider to perform or assist with on-line surveys, contests, sweepstakes or other promotions, which may include help with administering the survey or promotion, compiling the data or providing customer support. These parties will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement prior to performing any services with METUS and will be legally obligated not to disclose any personal information received from you. When we conduct a survey, we will make every effort to let you know how the information will be collected and used.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the option not to provide personal information to METUS. If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit most of the Sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services that involve our interaction with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold any personal information.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Children
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), as well as various other state laws, prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the collection, use, and/or disclosure of personal information from and about children on the Internet. METUS does not knowingly collect information from children nor does it target its Site or mobile applications to children less than 13 years of age. Children without the consent of their parent or guardian should not submit personal Information to the Site. If we discover that we have collected the personal information of a child, as defined by law, we will take immediate steps to handle that information in accordance with the law. Any minor under 18 years of age may also remove, or request and obtain removal of, online content that is collected and stored when such information is submitted by the user by directly contacting the Webmaster. METUS encourages all parents or guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their personal information while using the Internet.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Choices In Selecting Privacy Preferences
    </h3>
    <p>
        You may, at your discretion, subscribe to and receive information related to METUS products and services, including general METUS communications by postal mail, email, telephone, or mobile device. You also have the right to make or change these preferences at any time. This option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering order completion, contracts, support, product safety warnings, or other administrative and transactional notices where the primary purpose of these communications is not promotional in nature.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Access To And Accuracy Of Your Information
    </h3>
    <p>
        METUS wants to ensure that it accurately records your personal information. You have the right to request the disclosure of your personal information in our possession and mandate revisions when necessary. METUS offers you ways to update and/or to delete incorrect information, barring the need to retain it for legitimate business or legal purposes. In order to update your personal information, METUS may, for your personal protection, require you to verify your identity before we honor the request. In cases where the request is unreasonably repetitive, requires disproportionate technical effort, risks the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, METUS may reject the request and work with you to find an alternative solution. Please note that requests made over the phone may be recorded to ensure proper response to your request.
    </p>
    <p>
        To request more details about the personal information that you directly provided to METUS, click the appropriate web link above or contact METUS at 1-833-638-1096 for assistance. Please note that we require certain pieces of personal information, such as name, and email address or telephone number in order to find you in our systems. This may be more information than we have collected previously. METUS will respond to any such request in an appropriate manner and within a reasonable timeframe.
    </p>
    <p>
        METUS operates in such a way to protect information from accidental or malicious destruction. As such, subsequent to your request to delete personal information from our system, we reserve the right to retain residual copies from our active servers for a short period of time and may not remove information from our backup systems.

    <h3>
        Metahvac Ads And Offerings On Third-Party Websites
    </h3>
    <p>
        METUS may contract with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties. In addition, some websites may be “powered by” a service provider to provide METUS offers on METUS’s behalf. These service providers may send cookies and use web beacons on these third-party websites and on our Sites. The cookies and web beacons may enable METUS to collect information about the pages you viewed and the links you clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most web browsers offer you the ability to inform websites and ad networks that you do not want your online activities tracked through a “Do Not Track” feature. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many online services, METUS does not currently alter its practices when it receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor’s browser.
    </p>
    <p>
