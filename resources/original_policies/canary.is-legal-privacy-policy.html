            <ul>
                <li>necessary to perform a contract we have with you, such as providing our Products in accordance with the legal terms available at <a href="/legal">canary.is/legal</a>;</li>
                <li>you have consented to certain processing, which you may revoke at any time;</li>
                <li>required for Canary to comply with a court order or another legal obligation, or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims;</li>
                <li>you have made the information manifestly public;</li>

            </ul></div><h3 id="choices-to-limit-collection" class="section__title">5. Choices You Have to Limit Information Collection</h3><div><br>
            <p><strong>Location Services</strong></p>
            <p>Some features of our Mobile App use precise location-based data. If you allow these features, we will locate you using the Wi-Fi routers and the cell IDs of the towers closest to you. We use this information to facilitate the Equipment's automatic mode switching, for customer support, and to provide you with local emergency services contact information. We also may use this information when you use the Safety Button feature of our Mobile App, to provide first responders with your location. You may disable location services within your phone’s settings menu.</p>
            <p><strong>Video &amp; Audio</strong></p>
            <p>You may configure your Canary Product from within the Mobile App to capture video and audio within the camera’s range and provide you with notifications. You can set your Canary Product to different modes from within the mobile app menu. Each mode determines when Canary records audio and video and when you receive notifications and can be customized depending on your settings. You should inform guests of any recording if the camera is on while others are in your home.</p>
            <p>You may enable privacy mode or disable recording from within the Mobile App menu to prevent the recording of video and audio through the Equipment. In privacy mode, the watch live video feature and event notifications are disabled and the camera and microphone are turned off. Your Equipment will continue to monitor environmental activity in privacy mode so we may provide you with aggregated Home Health information. LED lights on the bottom of the Product will be turned off to indicate the Equipment is in privacy mode.</p></div><h3 id="how-canary-shares-your-information" class="section__title">6.

            <p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong>
                <br> California residents have the additional privacy rights described below. In this section of our privacy policy, we use the terms “personal information” and “sale” as they are defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).</p>
            <p>Disclosures Regarding Your Personal Information</p>
            <p>We collect the categories of personal information from or about you as disclosed above under the caption “Information Canary Collects.” To learn about the business or commercial purposes for which we use this information, see above under the caption “How Canary Uses Your Information.” To learn about the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information for a business purpose, see above under the caption, “How Canary Shares Your Information.”</p>
            <p>California Privacy Rights</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Right to Know: You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months: the categories of personal information we have collected; the categories of sources from which we collected personal information; our business or commercial purpose for collecting personal information; the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information, and the categories of personal information we shared with each of them ;whether we’ve sold your personal information to third parties, and if so, the categories of personal information we’ve sold to each category of third party.</li>
                <li>Access: You can request a copy of the personal information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.</li>
                <li>Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete the personal information that we have collected about you subject to exceptions. For example, we may retain personal information to comply with laws, to identify errors, to maintain security, to provide you our Products, or to complete a transaction or other action you have requested.</li>
                <li>Do Not Sell: Canary does not sell your personal information, so CCPA “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” choices do not apply. If you send us a “do not sell” request, we will treat it as a request to opt out of marketing communications by or on behalf of Canary.</li>
                <li>Right to Non-Discrimination: we will not discriminate against you for exercising your California privacy rights.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Exercising Your Rights</p>
            <p>California residents may exercise their rights described above by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Calling and leaving us a message at: 1-888-358-0286 or</li>
                <li>Emailing us at: privacy_support@canary.is</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may need to verify your identity and state of residence before we can fulfill your request.</p>
            <p>You may also authorize an agent to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your authorized agent with written permission to exercise your rights, and we will request a copy of this written permission from your authorized agent when they make a request on your behalf, and will verify the authorized agent’s identity.</p>
            <p>We will respond to any valid request within 45 days of receipt, or 90 days if we notify you that we need more time. We will not charge you a fee for making a request unless your request is excessive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Nevada Privacy Rights</strong>
                <br> Nevada residents have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain personal information to third parties who intend to license or sell that personal information. We do not currently sell your personal information as sales are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A. You can exercise your opt-out right as to any potential future sales by emailing privacy_support@canary.is with the subject line “Nevada Do Not Sell Request” and providing us with your name.</p>
            <p><strong>Notification of Privacy Policy Changes</strong>
                <br> We may update this Policy to reflect changes to our information practices or changes to our Products. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account), through a push-notification, or by means of a notice in the app prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p></div><h3 id="contact-us" class="section__title">12. Contact Us</h3><div><br>
